{"id":"4495010058","adHeader":"Felony Drug Defense - Flat Fee, Free Consult, Local Attorney","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/lgs/4495010058.html","adDetails":"William Safford, CA Bar #286948 show contact info show contact info For more than forty years, America has been fighting a \"war on drugs\". In the course of this \"war\", millions of people have been arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for years. The result is a generation of broken families, joblessness, and homelessness. However, there is good news - just because you have been charged with a drug crime does not mean that you should give up hope! A competent defense attorney can employ a wide range of strategies designed to pick apart the District Attorney's case. Charges can be dismissed at preliminary hearings, evidence can be suppressed, and police misconduct can be put under the microscope. Then, even if the deck seems stacked against you, California law provides many people with options such as diversion, deferred judgment, and Prop. 36 probation. The important thing is knowing your options - whether you take a deal or go to trial, you need an attorney who will be with you all the way and give you the best possible defense at every stage. http://www.saffordlegal.com I believe that everyone deserves excellent legal counsel - no matter how \"small\" your case or how thin your wallet, you deserve a lawyer whose sole job is looking out for your interests. That is why, in most cases, I offer flat fees - so that you know, up front, how much your case is going to cost. Before I moved to the Bay Area, I worked for criminal defense firms in Colorado and Ohio. We handled every type of misdemeanor and felony case, from the smallest infraction to serious felonies such as drug trafficking, sex offenses, armed robbery, and violent crime. I have experience working with witness testimony, scientific/forensic evidence, and the murky depths of criminal law. Even if you haven't been charged with a crime, if you have had contact with the police, or believe you are being investigated, it is never too early to get some help.
