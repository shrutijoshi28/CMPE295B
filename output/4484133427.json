{"id":"4484133427","adHeader":"Slide Guitar Lessons: All Genres and Eras... Beginner to Very Advanced","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4484133427.html","adDetails":"Using slide technique over non-traditional blues scales opens up possibilities for your originals that do not fall into the conventional Blues sound. This sound can be heard in the recordings of Ry Cooder, Sonny Landreth, and Kelly Joe Phelps to name a few. I teach a chord/melody slide approach that allows one to pull the song off as a soloist or an electric guitar approach where one solos using single lines. Private lessons to enhance your existing slide guitar skills or to get you started on the right track if you are a beginner. Although I specialize in a country Blues and electric guitar sound honed from learning songs from Son House to Duane Allman, I also add slide to many of my original R&B, Rock, and Folk tunes. If you would like to learn how to use a slide sound over your original recordings or want to learn to play your favorite slide tunes/licks (or I can suggest them), please email me for more information. Lessons @ my studio or online/Skype.... house calls available for a premium.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:16:57-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
