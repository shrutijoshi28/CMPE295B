{"id":"4502369952","adHeader":"Affordable sailing lessons","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lss/4502369952.html","adDetails":"Learn to sail on San Francisco Bay on a modern 43ft Beneteau sailboat by Fisherman's Wharf. Very reasonable rates ($40 per person per hour) for up to four students per session. Lessons can be as short as 2 hours and you'll get plenty of hands on experience raising and lowering the sails, learning to steer the boat, and little by little I'll introduce you to more advanced techniques and fine tuning. These are informal with no certifications. I'm planning a world circumnavigation and I'm just trying to make some extra money on the side while meeting some new people. This is a great way to get your feet wet and decide if sailing is right for you! It's also a great way to destress after a day at work :) I'm available Monday-Thursday from 3-8pm.","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.800200","longitude":"-122.409100","info":""}}
