I am an instructor at a University teaching in the School of Communication. Along with working with students in the classroom I enjoy freelance writing. I'm very good, can write on a variety of topics and always meet deadlines. My fees are: $50 for up to one hour After the first hour the cost is 50 cents per minute In other words, if I work on a project for 83 minutes the cost would be: $50 (for the first hour) + $11.50 (for the remaining 23 minutes) for a total of $63.50. Thanks and I look forward to working with you.
