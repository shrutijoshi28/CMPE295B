I teach students of all levels and ages. I love working with children as well as adults and teenagers, whether they have professional aspirations or just want to enjoy singing as a hobby. I love and have performed in many different genres of singing, including classical, jazz, musical theater, and pop. I am a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher, and I desire to help every student develop a love of music and become the very best they can be, while working toward goals that will bring them satisfaction and accomplishment. I believe every person's voice is a unique instrument that should have the opportunity to be developed to its full potential. My approach to technique emphasizes freedom of tone and expression from well-supported breath. You can watch a performance of mine singing with the San Francisco Conservatory Baroque Ensemble here: http://youtu.be/VkpHrdtJTlo Rates: $30 for a 30-minute lesson, $45 for a 45-minute lesson, and $60 for a 60-minute lesson Email me if you'd like to set up a trial lesson! Here is my bio: Accomplished as both a pianist and a singer, Jacquelyn Weitz first came to San Francisco in 2010 to study piano at the San Francisco Conservatory, where she won the piano concerto competition and performed with the orchestra the following year. After graduating, she auditioned and was accepted into the Master's program in vocal performance, where she now studies with Jane Randolph. This spring Weitz was one of three finalists in the San Francisco Conservatory's Voice Concerto Competition. In March Jacquelyn sang the role of \"Romilda\" in the San Francisco Conservatory Baroque Ensemble's Production of Serse. She also performed as the \"Young Maid\" in the Conservatory's Musical Theater performance of Bernarda Alba. Other roles Weitz has sung include \"Miss Silverpeal\" in Mozart's Impresario and \"Lucy\" in Menotti's The Telephone with the Rimrock Opera. Raised in Montana, Jacquelyn earned her Bachelor's Degree in Piano and Vocal Performance from Montana State University Billings. She also holds a Master's Degree in Piano Performance from Texas Christian University, as well as a Professional Studies Diploma in Piano performance from the San Francisco Conservatory. I look forward to hearing from you!","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:35:16-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.794398","longitude":"-122.426514","info":"Pacific Ave at Gough St "}}
