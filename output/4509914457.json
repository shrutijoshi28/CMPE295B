The quality of workmanship is down and there are only a few in my opinion that still take pride in the quality of workmanship that is shown to the customers. I have looked at many job's and have seen the quality of work and the lack of understanding the Uniform Plumbing Code. I am a Master Plumber by trade and I am willing to offer my services at a discounted rate, since most of us out there are having problems due to the state of the economy. I have a low over head so I can do most job's at a fraction of what you would pay a large shop.
