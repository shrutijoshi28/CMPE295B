All levels welcome. I'm located near the19th Street Bart station. We can work on whatever interests you have: theory, technique, reading, or just learning songs. I have over 300 songs I can teach you, by a large range of artists like Nirvana, The Black Keys, Beatles, White Stripes, Marley, Taylor Swift, Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Green Day, Grateful Dead, Hank Williams Sr., T-Bone Walker, Elliott Smith, Bob Wills, James Brown, Dick Dale, The Pixies, and many others. As a musician, I've made many recordings and played hundreds of shows, including several performances at venues like The Bottom of the Hill, The Great American Music Hall and Slim's as well as music festivals like Noise Pop and North by Northwest. As a teacher, I'm a patient person who believes in positive reinforcement. Having taught well over 1000 students, I've instructed people ranging from a 5-year-old boy to a 65-year-old grandmother; from \"geniuses\" who seem like they were born to play music to people with ADD and autism. And I have yet to encounter a student that couldn't learn to play music! I also teach rock band lessons (See photos). Band performances are at The Starry Plough. Here's a video from a student band performance in May 2013: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJCLnbkuM_A AND...a very young band of my student rockers playing Come Together in January 2014. If you think videos of kittens on Facebook are cute, you ain't seen nothing yet! (Make sure you catch the guitar solo at 2:00) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJoaFoEjrXo Students take a half hour lesson each week and get plenty of material to work on (no need for an hour lesson, unless you're a very dedicated student who plans on practicing 5-10 hours every week!). Contact me for a free introductory meeting/lesson. And...DISCOUNT for students who can make their lessons on weekdays before 3:00PM!!!
