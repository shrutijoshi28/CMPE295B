{"id":"4489088707","adHeader":"Personal assistant","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/hss/4489088707.html","adDetails":"Need an extra hand around your home, or your home office? I'm a qualified legal secretary hunting for a job, but with many other talents and skills. Need somebody to organize and sort? Do bookkeeping, transcription or any sort of office work? Run errands? Do light cleaning and laundry? Weed the yard? Walk the dog? Tutor the kids in English or walk them? Sit with your elderly parent while you are partying? Very reasonable rates. Please include your phone number in your reply. Let's talk about it. Given the last few responses to this ad, I do need to clarify one or two things. I do drive, but I don't own a car. If I could afford to own a car in San Francisco, I'd have no need to do part-time and temporary work. And no, this is not a disguised ad for offering the kind of services illegal on Craigslist. I'm a responsible and mature individual, old enough to be your auntie or your grandma. Sorry about that.","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:18:17-0700","subCategory":{"category":"household services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/hss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.781200","longitude":"-122.461400","info":""}}
