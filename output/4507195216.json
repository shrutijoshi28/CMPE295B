The bookkeeper maintains complete and up-to-date detailed accounts receivable, accounts payable and cash account ledgers and provides daily or weekly reports on these and other critical areas of business management. The bookkeeper either processes payroll or makes the necessary entries to record payroll processed by a third-party provider. In either case, payroll entries will include complete recording of gross wages, employer tax and other payroll expenses, and payroll liabilities. Your Controller Your controller conducts a periodic review of your general ledger with the bookkeeper to ensure all activity is correct and all necessary cash-to-accrual or income recognition adjustments have been made. After each monthly review, the controller issues financial statements and locks your accounting data file for the period so that no data can be changed after the reports are issued without the controller's full knowledge and permission. The controller then distributes the financial reports package for the month to designated personnel at your company. This report package includes a management letter explaining the significance of your financial reports and calling your attention to critical business ratios and areas of concern. Also included is an invitation to meet with the controller for a thorough review and discussion of your financial reports. http://www.TaxGirls.com and www.BookkeeperGirls.com Call show contact info tax services, Bookkeeping service, Bay Area Bookkeeping, bookkeeping online, cloud based bookkeeping, full service bookkeeping, north bay bookkeeping, protecting personal assets, quickbooks, bookkeeper, bookkeeping solutions tax services, Bookkeeping service, Bay Area Bookkeeping, bookkeeping online, cloud based bookkeeping, full service bookkeeping, north bay bookkeeping, protecting personal assets, quickbooks, bookkeeper, bookkeeping solutions, tax services, Bookkeeping service, Bay Area Bookkeeping, bookkeeping online, cloud based bookkeeping, full service bookkeeping, north bay bookkeeping, protecting personal assets, quickbooks, bookkeeper, bookkeeping solutions tax services, Bookkeeping service, Bay Area Bookkeeping, bookkeeping online, cloud based bookkeeping, full service bookkeeping, north bay bookkeeping, protecting personal assets, quickbooks, bookkeeper, bookkeeping solutionsdo NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers","postDate":"2014-06-10T17:55:55-0700","subCategory":{"category":"financial services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fns/"},"location":{"lattitude":"38.441397","longitude":"-122.711704","info":"740 Fourth Street "}}
