{"id":"4476936241","adHeader":"Dog boarding in my home","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/pas/4476936241.html","adDetails":"Dog boarding in my home Your dog must be older than one year, friendly, completely house broken, neutered, and no escape artists or diggers please! I never kennel dogs, and only use crates if they come with the dog. Dogs are supervised at all times. We have a large back yard with a doggie door, and all dogs are allowed or kept in the house during the day and especially at night with the dog door closed. If you have an older dog who needs peace and quiet that's OK too. (I also have a few qualified helpers who can stay in your home). Limit is two to three boarding at one time, and an interview with all of us well before boarding time is necessary. If your dog gets along well at dog parks, that's a plus, but it's not necessary. I have over 20 years' experience caring for dogs, and know when to leave a dog park. Long walks are good too if you would prefer. We miss our old yellow Lab Sutter, so are happy when we have dogs in the house. Your dog will be treated as one of the family, and cared for with love. I have experience giving meds., including insulin shots. You will provide food for your dog, as it's not wise to change his/her diet too quickly. We are covered by liability insurance and are bonded for any dog in our care -- in our home, on a walk, in the car or at the dog park. Good references available.
