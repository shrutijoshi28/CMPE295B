I have 3 stall/paddocks available, and 1 paddock w/ shelter (same as pasture board, $295) close to beautiful Annadel Park trail head, less than 5 min walk. Offering large paddocks and daily turnout (weather permitting) no flooding, warm water wash area, cross tie, matted stalls, tack room. I don't have an arena or round pen, but the turnout area is flat and a good size if you want to lunge or work your horse. I prefer geldings. The stall board is $395.mo and includes hay 2x/day.
