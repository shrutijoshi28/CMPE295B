I'm not being over-confident about myself or the services that I offer, but the truth is that I know the economy is not that great and everyone wants to save some money on their renovation project. I have over 900 hardwood flooring samples at our warehouse that could be picked up or delivered to your home regardless if you want us to lay the floors or not. Simply put, you can just buy top quality flooring at a discounted rate (even cheaper than Lumber Liquidators) or come down to our shop, pick out a floor, and have us install it at an All-Inclusive rate between 3.99 to 5.99/Sqft. -- THE PRICE REFLECTS ON BOTH THE FLOORING MATERIALS & LABOR!!!*; (e.g.: you got 600/Sqft, then times that by 3.99 per square then that's your ballpark figure - *the moldings/baseboards are NOT included) of course, if you choose a higher end brand of flooring then the price go up a little, but you'll still be saving THOUSANDS when compared to the other guys. My name is HARRY, please let me show you how to save BIG $$$ on your hardwood floor project. FREE Estimates.
