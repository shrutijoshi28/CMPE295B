I'm a professional cellist and music teacher offering cello and piano lessons to students of all ages and skill levels. I currently teach at a couple of locations in San Francisco and the East Bay, and also give private lessons outside of those studios. A little about me: Since graduating with a Master's in Classical Cello from SUNY Purchase Conservatory in 2005, I've performed in a variety of genres (indie-rock bands and singer-songwriters to Broadway rock musicals and classical ensembles). I have many years experience teaching cello and beginning-intermediate piano to both kids and adults. I also teach beginning guitar, drums, ukelele and music theory/notation, can play by ear, and can transcribe music if you are looking to learn a specific song/piece. Depending on your location, I am available to travel to your home for lessons. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. Thanks, Ben","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.758700","longitude":"-122.433000","info":""}}
