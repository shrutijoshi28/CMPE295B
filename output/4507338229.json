They can join our family until your return. A \"home away from home\". You will have the peace of mind knowing that your dog/s will be treated like a member of the family in our comfy home with large fenced yard. They will have our two small dogs (shih-poos) and two kids (11 and 13 yrs old) to play with, and daily neighborhood walks and weekend jaunts to the beach or dog park. They will sleep in their bed/crate in our bedroom. We will take care of and love your dog/s while you are away.
