{"id":"4514554929","adHeader":"College Application Advisor $30","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/lss/4514554929.html","adDetails":"I am a UC Berkeley undergraduate who went through the college admissions process last fall. I will provide insight and advice regarding admissions. I will also edit personal statements and essays. From my own experiences and those of my friends, I have a fundamental understanding of what universities are looking for and how to achieve that. I can share my own college application (UC application and Common App). Email me first, then we can text or call if that is more convenient. I charge $30 an hour. This information gives any high school students priceless insight into the overwhelming abyss that is college admissions. For younger grades --freshmen and sophomores-- I can suggest routes to take regarding extracurriculars and classes. For juniors and seniors, I can help write essays, review applications, etc. Let me know!","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:10:05-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.517400","longitude":"-122.292700","info":""}}
