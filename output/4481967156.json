We're absolutely in love with love... and understand that you want someone there to capture every detail of a day that goes by much too quickly! With the advantages of two photographers, we are able to capture many different angles and make sure every aspect is covered. Please visit our Website to view more of our portfolio and for contact information. We'd love to help make your special day perfect in every way!! We make great efforts with your wedding day images. They are unique, expressive, and artistic. Your wedding portraits reveal the story of your whole wedding day and should reflect you as a couple, and as individuals. You cherish the moments for a lifetime. Please give us a call to check our availability. We only do one event per day, and once the date's locked down- It's gone. We do require a $100 Deposit to save the date which is deducted from the $650 total.
