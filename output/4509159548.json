My name is David Lessin and I am a creative, top-rated professional wedding photographer. I love what I do--I capture authentic, meaningful wedding images without posing or rehearsing. My secret is simple--I take care of my brides by helping them feel joyful, relaxed, confident, connected and beautiful throughout their wedding day and by making sure that we have a good time doing it. I have been blessed to photograph some of the biggest, most over-the-top Bay Area weddings and I love them. But I miss the smaller, more intimate weddings that originally helped me fall in love with wedding photography in the first place. So, I have decided that it's my turn to give back a little by offering young couples a few, select dates to save 50% off my regular rate. You do not have to settle by hiring an inexperienced, bargain rate, photographer. For about the same price that you would expect to pay an amateur, you now have an opportunity to work with an amazing, top-flight professional photographer, capture the most incredible wedding images and truly enjoy yourself on your wedding day. The first step is to see if I am available. Please let me know when you are getting married by calling me at show contact info or emailing me using the Craigslist email system. If I am available, I will be happy to meet with you over coffee and discuss the details of your wedding. I can show you some of my most recent work and take you through some complete, delivered weddings so you will have an idea of what you can expect from your finished wedding photographs. Here's my promise to you: We will capture the magic and the emotions of your wedding day and we will have a great time doing it. You will feel relaxed and beautiful and confident and have the wedding photographs that you have always dreamed about. It's easy to get started by checking my availability! Please give me a call at show contact info or email me using the Craigslist email system and let me know the date of your wedding. And to see more samples of my wedding photography, please visit my website at: DavidLessin.com I am looking forward to speaking with you about your wedding.
