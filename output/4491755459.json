( I'M IN HAYWARD. Phone No- (51o) 415-8686 I work on any computer issues you may have. I repeat \"ANY \". My charges are way more less than the other. Though my work is professional plus I work from my home. I charge \" $30 for 95% \" of the time but sometimes when system has lot of issues or big issue it takes time. Only then i just charge for my time. \"MY CHARGES ARE REASONABLE I DON'T CHARGE LIKE OTHER\". 101% price guarantee in the area. Peoples always feel much happy with my service. So they usually pay me more. Even i don't ask them. If others say we can't fix your computer not a problem for me. Just bring it over here you have nothing to lose. Please let me take a look. \" THERE IS NO CHARGES FOR DIAGNOSIS. FIRST I PREFER MY CUSTOMER 101% SATISFACTION AFTER THAT MONEY \" Free help only for those who are financially disabled. Please Don't try to be smart. If I'm honest with you that is also your responsibility to be honest with me. I will feel happy to help. NOTE: I'm not saying you to come to me. But please where ever you go first make sure that guy is correct for your needs. There are lots of scam running on Craigslist. Your safety is first. I work from my home. Plus most people here just know how to change a hard drive and install a operating system and feel they can call themselves COMPUTER REPAIR GUY. So my point is here be careful when you do business on Craigslist. There are only few peoples whom you can trust. NOBODY CAN BEAT MY PRICE. AND NOBODY CAN BEAT MY SERVICE. My service is way more faster than others. Typically I can have most repairs done within a few hours. No matter whatever issue you have I will try to do it within few hours. I have all the spare parts with me plus i work from my home. If you go to store or someone else they guys will charge you much more and may take weeks to get your computer back to you.
