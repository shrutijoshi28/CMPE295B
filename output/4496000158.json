I used the same system to get a 3.93 GPA at UC Berkeley while only studying for 2 hours a day ►Step by step homework assistance. In addition, I'll teach you how to systematically solve problems that seem difficult at first. ►Confidence to do well in Chem 1A. You'll walk into exams with complete confidence because you understand the material so well. There Are Other Tutors Out There. Why Should You Hire Me? What separates me from other chemistry tutors is that I don't focus solely on comprehension of the class material. Acing the class involves more than just understanding the material. Sure comprehension is important, but if you can't apply the material, then your grade will suffer. If you can't deconstruct a problem, and figure out which concept to use, your grade will plummet. If you can't select the right answer among answers that all sound somewhat correct, your grade will drop. Etc. I help you improve on all these areas so that when the exam comes around, you'll be ready to rock it. Secondly, I won't just teach you chemistry. I will also teach you a study system that maximizes your efficiency so you finish your homework faster. Using this system, you'll be able study less while still get good grades. Personally I used this study system at UC Berkeley and it allowed me to get a 3.93 GPA while only studying for two hours a day. This system is extremely easy to implement and it will help you get higher grades in high school and in college. Most tutors don't even teach you basic study skills. Pricing $45 / hour Other tutors charge much more and they don't change their teaching to fit your unique learning style, nor do they teach you a study system that almost guarantees academic success.
