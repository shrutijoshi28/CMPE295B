Many of you have forgotten and some of you have never known what the 13th Octave is and hence we tell you again it is the heart of One. It is all it is the body, mind, spirit, will, and love of what you think of as God. It is beyond physicality; it is far beyond what you think of within the available realm of twelve plains, and twelve dimensions, the twelve levels of existence. It is a state of being in which you are All; it is a closing of the circle to go home, beyond any existence, any lifetime, any reality, any universe, it is to simply be with One. La means Light and Love of God. Ho means Movement. Chi refers to Life Force. Hence, LaHoChi is the movement of light into your body at the speed of Love. The speed of Love = speed of Light squared. 13th Octave LaHoChi is the next step in energy healing, a quantum leap available now to the healers and people of Nova Earth. It has always been a multiple purpose modality, not only for healing but also for creation. As we as a collective move into conscious co-creation -- the quantum leap into multi-dimensional and uni-dimensional co-creation, it is time to use this incredible energy for the creation of our healing practices, teaching, as well as the healing and creation of Nova Earth. \" - Linda Dillon ANGEL LIGHT HEALING - FREE ANGEL LIGHT HEALING INITIATION - FREE 13TH OCTAVE LAHOCHI (R) - ATTUNEMENT & HEALING $150/hour (2 hour minimum) $120/flat-fee remote w/20 min.
