{"id":"4505402919","adHeader":"PT Nanny with 20 Years Experience","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/hss/4505402919.html","adDetails":"I am a woman in my late 30's with 20 years experience in childcare. I have glowing references. I have no children and am completely flexible. I've worked in a preschool and also as a private nanny for children ages infant to 15. I am first aid and infant/child CPR certified. I love and respect children and when you leave your children with me you can rest assured that they are getting quality care and years of experience. I have a very nurturing spirit. I have reliable transportation. My rate starts at $15 an hour for 1 child and I'm looking for a minimum of 18 hours a week and not more than 32 hours a week. I work as an independent contractor for cash. I can begin immediately. Thank you for your consideration.","subCategory":{"category":"household services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/hss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.135300","longitude":"-121.650100","info":""}}
