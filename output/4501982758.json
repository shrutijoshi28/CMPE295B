RAIN OR SHINE, I can help you to haul your stuff, if you are moving or buying stuff in IKEA, COSTCO, CRAIGSLIST, BEST BUY, or any other furniture store. You don't have to rent a uhaul truck and pay a bunch of fees. I don't haul any junk or trash on my truck, so I have a very clean truck.You would get my help and my truck to load and unload your stuff, you won't pay for gas, I have ratchetable straps, tie downs, and blankets to secure your items. My rate starts at $40 for local hauling. I AM FLEXIBLE AND AN EASY GOING PERSON. All you have to do is give me a call at show contact info. My name is IGNACIO.
