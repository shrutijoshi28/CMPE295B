I have been teaching since 1998. I teach with the Piano Adventures material, then I incorporate the Suzuki material, and from there we go into classical, ragtime, pop and beyond. We also explore how to be creative in your practice, and we look for ways to make it fun and enjoyable. A lot of my younger students like to create their own songs or improvise, and I encourage, assist and inspire them in their process. All levels and ages are welcome. For availability and tuition, please reply to this ad. Thank you.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:06:01-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.330447","longitude":"-121.951675","info":""}}
