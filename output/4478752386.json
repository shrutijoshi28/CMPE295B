A brand new piano class has been offered at the Yu-Ai Kai Center in San Jose Japantown. The class will be held in a \"masterclass\" format. Essentially, each student in the class will prepare a piece, perform it in front of the class, then the instructor will make comments to the student (just like a 1-on-1 lesson) in front of the whole class. Then students take turns performing. It is good to watch other students be critiqued as well, as it helps your listening skills and understanding of the music as well. All genres of music welcome, as the instructor also enjoys playing a wide variety of music! I have 20 years of playing experience and have performed in various competitions and venues, including in Hawaii, California, and Japan. I also give a free monthly performance at the Yu-Ai Kai. I currently teach private in-home and studio piano lessons in Silicon Valley. My full bio as well as sample videos are on my website at www.gkpiano.com Go to the \"Instruction\" tab then \"Adult Class\" Here's the details: Every Monday, beginning June 16th, 2014 Two different sessions offered: 4:30 - 5:30, 7:45 - 8:45 PM Yu-Ai Kai in San Jose Japantown 588 N 4th St, San Jose, CA 95112 $45 per 5 week session Ability to read basic/simple notes preferred, but not required (primarily for adults, but children are welcome to attend as well!)
