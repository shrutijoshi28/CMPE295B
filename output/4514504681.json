He also knows his stuff extremely well.\" \"Mark is the best! He is a wonderful teacher, extremely patient and works at whatever level and speed each student desires. I find him insanely funny, which helps when I'm trying to weasel my way through the fact that I haven't practiced each week :) I have learned more theory from Mark playing guitar than I did in my 10+ years of classical piano playing. I enjoy our group lessons the best, where we learn how to play with other people and have the opportunity to improvise.\" \"Mark is the complete package. He can teach on all levels and take you through the theory of it. He removes the mystery. He has the educational resume and years of playing experience. With Mark you get to pull back the curtain and see the wizard.\" \"Mark Kennedy taught me everything I know about guitar and bass as a child and young adult. I have since played all over the world with many well known performers. Without that original knowledge, I would never have had a career as a professional musician.\"","postDate":"2014-06-10T17:33:36-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.758773","longitude":"-122.414260","info":""}}
