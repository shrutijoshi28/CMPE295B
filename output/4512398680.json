Are you interested in the Russian culture or language? Would you like to speak it colloquially or for certain purposes? Do you have a Russian boyfriend or girlfriend? In any case, I can help you learn more of it, or introduce you to it if you are a beginner. I am in my 20's and I grew up in Russia. I have had experience tutoring in Russia as well as in the United States. I speak English and Russian at an equal level. I reached that level in English studying at a private English school in Russia as well as studying Linguistics (Interpreting). I am extremely flexible in my approach to teaching, since I know that every person should be treated individually, depending on his level, speed of learning, etc. We can focus on any area you would like whether it is writing, speaking or reading. If you are interested in learning Russian online through skype, you can visit WWW.RUSSIANTIPS.ORG and find out more information about me and the lessons there. Please, e-mail me if you want to find out more details, or start learning Russian! I charge $35 per lesson in person (per hour) or online through Skype. I also offer translation services, please feel free to contact me about that as well. Thank you!
