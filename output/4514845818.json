Do you want to lose some weight? Tone up? Get stronger? I will help you with that!!! I train people at their houses (garage, basement) backyards or at parks. I have my own equipment, so you don't have to worry about anything. I treat each client individually! It's you and YOUR goal! We also talk about nutrition plan, which is a big part of any training. One-on-one training is available, but partner training, small group training as well. I am a very energetic person, love training, love helping people - I will get you where you want to be, cause it's all about feeling good with your own body!
