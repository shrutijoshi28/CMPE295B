I completed my Bachelor of Music degree in piano performance from San Francisco State University in 2010. I also have recently completed my Masters degree in piano performance in 2013 as well. I am currently seeking students who would like me to come to their home for lessons. I teach children age 4 and up as well as adults. I aim to make piano lessons as enjoyable as possible as well as to accommodate each person's individual aspirations, requests, and needs. I am classically trained and my lessons include a solid foundation in general music. My rates are $50/hr , $37/45 minute and $25/half hr. For additional information or scheduling please contact me by phone show contact info) or by replying to this message. Please also check out some of the following reviews given by parents and adult students. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \"Great teacher, my kid has imporved A LOT!!!!\" 5/5 stars o Bon L o San Francisco, CA Review of Alexi Vuckovich, March 17, 2010 My daughter has been learning piano for 6 years and for the past 4 years she hated a lot until 2 years ago when Alexi came along. Her attitude towards piano started to change from hate to accept. Alexi has a lot of patience and his goal is to become a teacher. Therefore, he has heart to teach and not just to make money. With his teaching style, he is more into encouraging rather than criticizing, so my kid has improved a lot! Now, my kid is learning violin as well but we still have Alexi to teach her piano because of his great effort. Her violin teacher said my kid has a very solid musical background. Therefore, she doesn't have to spend time to teach her to read music and she even picks up faster than other students, thanks Alexi for your good work! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \"Outstanding Teacher\" 5/5 stars o Tong Ginn o San Francisco, CA Review of Alexi Vuckovich, January 31, 2010 I knew nothing about playing the piano a year and a half ago and then I started with Alexi. I've stuck with him and the piano because he is very supportive. He has worked with me when I didn't practice. Whenever he is in danger of being late, he has warned me. I was concerned that, as accomplished as he is on the piano, he wouldn't want to sit through my repeated attempts at scales. There must be cheaper teachers but this has been an investment in my capabilities that I've been very pleased with. If you know nothing and want to play the piano, Alexi can take you there. I've taught in corporate settings, at universities, abroad, and have my Single Subject Teaching Credential. It is necessary to know the piano to teach it and Alexi knows the piano. I can tell without his showing off. But more than that, he knows how to share his knowledge. I've never had any regrets about being his student. I'm glad to let others know that this is a teacher who can get you playing. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ \"Oustanding teacher, very patient\" 5/5 stars o sokolj o San Francisco, CA Review of Piano Instruction, August 16, 2009 Alexi has been teaching my daughter for about 6 months. He's extremely patient with my 7 yr old and she's been progressing steadily. He's really done a great job building a rapport with her and she's responding to his methods. She's already playing Fur Elise with proper fingering and reads music well. Alexi has recently added a metronome to the mix and she's starting to do a better job playing in time.","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:57:27-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.744100","longitude":"-122.486300","info":""}}
