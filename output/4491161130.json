Are you an expert in your field or someone with a unique voice or approach to your subject? Are you planning to pitch your book idea to publishers or a literary agent? Then you need my expertise! I have more than ten years of professional experience as a book editor and have cowritten book proposals with authors. A recent book proposal that I cowrote, codeveloped, researched, and edited for a first-time author was successfully placed with a major publisher! Subjects with which I have experience and interest: Evidence-based self-help psychology (trade and professional books), personal growth, alternative spirituality, holistic health, memoir, permaculture and ecology, herbal medicine, music, art, law, ethics and compliance, e-learning, and business Please e-mail some information about the genre of your proposed book and your \"platform,\" which is your potential to promote the book; for example, if you have a specific area of expertise, then presumably you have garnered respect in your field by building a network of contacts or by associating with professional groups. (But don't worry if you don't have a large network right now; you can build your platform along the way.) I'll respond with my website address and contact info so that you can see the variety of projects I've participated in. We can take it from there.","subCategory":{"category":"writing/editing/translation","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/wet/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
