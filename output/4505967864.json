{"id":"4505967864","adHeader":"Macro Extraordinaire! Custom Macro Product Shoot Expert","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/crs/4505967864.html","adDetails":"I am a professional photographer with great equipment and a unique style. I am offering my services and creativity for a short time and at a great rate. I have a lot of expertise to offer and can adapt for every shoot. I love to shoot people and places and interiors. For product and macro photography, this is where skill, equipment, and patience really count. I shoot with professional macro lenses on a focus rail-mounted camera. I also use full spectrum LED's, halogens, tungstens, and a 2-light method. Sometimes 3 lights. I have a macro ring flash unit that mounts on all of my camera lenses as well. I use gloss (or matte) plastic sheets in your desired color for the backgrounds, and holding waxes to make the pieces seem to float. The focus rail allows me to precisely shoot objects at any aperture and not lose any depth of field since the final image is actually an image stack of the item at varying focal locations along the focal rail. I can even generat an instant 3d map with Helicon Focus/Helicon 3D viewer, for any style of glasses, including the older green/purple and the classic red-blue 3d, which takes me back to remembering Michael Caine in Jaws 3d. I am proficient with Photoshop and I am an advanced user that can utilize techniques like blemish removal, object removal/insertion, typography, special effects and other advanced artistic expressions. I use Helicon Pro for my focal rail stacks. I am enthusiastic about my work and I enjoy collaborating with clients in order to deliver what they want. I am flexible on pricing, and often do package deals. I think a good artist and photographer has to love every nanosecond of what they do, and I can easily say that I am living my dream.","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:22:10-0700","subCategory":{"category":"creative services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/crs/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
