Want to give your child a solid foundation for skateboarding? Do you want to learn skateboard basics or push yourself to the next level? Try a private skateboard lesson ! For over 3 years I have been leading skateboard clinics, teaching skateboarding in an after school program, and teaching private lessons to all ages and abilities. I have been skateboarding for more than 8 years and love to share my passion for skateboarding with others! I especially love to inspire and empower girls and women through skateboarding! I skate for fun and also skate contests; recently winning 1st in the 30 and over at Skate Like a Girl's Wheels of Fortune Contest and 1st place in Womens at the Bowlrrito held at Skatehouse Skate Park, South Lake Tahoe. Lessons are flexible for what you are interested in learning. For beginners, lessons usually focus on developing basic skills; foot placement, pushing, riding , turning, beginning tricks, 'reading' the park. Intermediate or advanced lessons focus on specific tricks you would like to learn, dropping in, handplants, front-side airs-whatever interests you. Lessons are usually between 1-2 hours long, depending on your needs. Can be held at most Bay Area skate parks (Berkeley, Fremont, Balboa, Waller and Stanyan etc.) . Hourly rate ranges between $45-60. If you're ready to shred, shoot me an email and let's get skating!","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:24:01-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
