(can give meds/shots)","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/pas/4514862097.html","adDetails":"Greetings fellow cat lovers! Travel often for work or play? Your cat sitter worries are over! I'm here to make daily or as needed visits to your home in San Francisco--I can also go to the Top of the Hill & Westlake areas of Daly City. Your cats will know that I'm a friend--I'll take great care of them. That includes giving meds or insulin shots if needed. $20 per visit covers all kitty needs and anything else that needs doing. Need me twice a day? Then it's $15 a visit. Lower flat rates available for regular/long term gigs or for seniors/disabled. No hidden fees or extra charges for 2-3 cats. Cash, check or Pay Pal OK. I've got the best references you can find & great reviews on Yelp. I'm also a freelance writer, extensively published in the LGBT press & SF Weekly. Email/text/call anytime.
