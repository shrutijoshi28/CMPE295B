{"id":"4505960707","adHeader":"Portrait Photographer Extraordinaire; Custom, Unique Work","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/crs/4505960707.html","adDetails":"I am a professional photographer with great equipment and a unique style. I am offering my services and creativity for a short time and at a great rate. I have a whole secret list of unique themes, tricks, techniques and locations awaiting perusal. I do have lighting equipment access and occasionally I can rent a studio but I tend to avoid plastic shoots devoid of true emotion and often choose to work in natural light. I prefer to do portraits in a unique location that speaks volumes about the individual, and preferably doing what they love so that the proper emotions are conveyed in the portrait. This custom attention to detail can make a subtle yet gradually powerful first impression. A staged picture of a person in a clinically foreign environment with the obligatory muslin background and a fake smile has worked for millions of people and schools, sure, but that is not what I am trying to do at all. If it isn't fun or it compromises my style I will have to turn the job down. Lately I have been developing some in-studio styles that are exciting, fresh, and engaging, utilizing older styles like the profile and silhouette style of portraits, which are as classy as antique cameos. Email for rates and link to prior work and portfolio, and I can show you what I can do.","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:22:01-0700","subCategory":{"category":"creative services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/crs/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
