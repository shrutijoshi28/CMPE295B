I have 5 years teaching and tutoring experience with grade levels 7-12, as well as special education students and English language learners. I have both my bachelor's degree and teaching credential in English and I enjoy tutoring on the side, especially in the summer months. Specializing in: - reading comprehension - elementary to advanced writing skills - college admission letter writing - literature analysis - spelling and grammar - test preparation, CAHSEE, EAP, SAT, etc. I currently teach 9th and 10th grade English, so I am well-versed in high school curriculum, but feel comfortable teaching at any level. If your student is looking to catch up or get ahead, I'd love to help them reach their academic goals! Schedule is still fairly open during the summer months. Tutoring Location: local library- Pleasanton or at your home Pricing: Individual tutoring ($40/hr; $50/hr @ your home) 2 person group tutoring available as well.
