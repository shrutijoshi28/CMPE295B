Longing for clarity, forgiveness and peace? Whatever your concern, I'm listening. I'm John Sullivan, a former Roman Catholic priest and emergency dispatcher for the US government. In both positions and throughout life, I have learned to listen to the deepest spiritual, emotional and practical issues. People often say that because I listen so attentively and lovingly, it's easier to find their own best wisdom. Inspired by my experience with confessions in the Catholic Church, I know that you may yearn for release from things about which you feel bad. Instead of following a formula or giving you a penance, I help you create your own best pathway to wash away guilt and restore yourself to your own and others' good graces. I also bring in wisdom from many spiritual traditions. If you wish, I can give you helpful resources for reflection and meditation. Not everyone needs therapy. Being heard can change how you listen to yourself and give you a new perspective on life. Call show contact info for a complementary 20-minute telephone session to determine how I might best serve you.","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:30:26-0700","subCategory":{"category":"small biz ads","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/biz/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.805156","longitude":"-122.230968","info":""}}
