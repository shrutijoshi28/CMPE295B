Specializing on automotive speakers and home speakers. Some speakers are impossible to find replacement so repair makes the most sense. I can repair broken or fraying foam on the speaker surround. Small size speaker is no problem. Ripped paper and polyurethan cone can also be repaired. Repair is between $50-70 per speaker. I can quote you if you send me a picture of the speaker.","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:06:51-0700","subCategory":{"category":"skilled trade services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sks/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.553800","longitude":"-122.270000","info":""}}
