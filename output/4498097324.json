Try online for 1/2 off!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4498097324.html","adDetails":"I think singing is for absolutely everyone who has the desire! You have a voice- so why not learn how to use it? It's great for your mind, body, and soul. AND I make it super fun! If you aren't laughing with me as you learn then I am not doing my job! And yes, I do indeed teach all styles. I am classically trained, but I am very very well versed in rock music as well! I also teach every other style imaginable, because I love it all. I also realize everyone is super busy these days, so I do NOT make you commit to weekly lessons. I customize, always! I even offer \"family lessons\", or lessons in pairs for bandmates, friends, etc. Even better: I offer Skype or FaceTime lessons! All you need is a mic and a good internet connection to learn how to sing with me. First online lesson is ALWAYS 1/2 off! I also offer discounted lesson packages. Convenient Hayward location. Very reasonable rates. I have friendly teaching assistants (meow!), a well-stocked candy bowl, a singing Elvis head, and lots of great music for us to choose from, as well as ear training software, music theory worksheets..everything for the complete musician!I even offer a convenient waiting room with plenty of reading material. Beginners, you're in good hands. I work with very shy people all the time to help them free their voice. I'm a member of NATS , Bay Area NATS, and VASTA. Additional studies include CoreSinging, Dalcroze, and much more. Many, many happy references available upon request. Some testimonials: \"As an older beginner, I really appreciate the way Molly does her best to put you at ease and make learning fun. My bandmates could tell I was taking lessons when I busted out 'Strangers in the Night' during sound check after only my second lesson. \" - Dean \" My daughter and niece, ages 5 and 10, have thoroughly enjoyed their voice lessons with Molly ... her teaching style allows for the children to have fun and relax while laying a musical foundation. The private lessons really give a confidence boost to my very shy daughter.\" -Kelly \"I'm a little shy to sing in front of people and I need a confidence boost but Molly is so easy to feel comfortable with and I find myself becoming more outgoing and willing to try new things with my voice\"- Sarahann Please visit my site to learn more about me and my voice lessons. I hope you'll be singing with me soon! http://www.vocalmolly.com","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:04:27-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.633200","longitude":"-122.097100","info":""}}
