We are seeking an investor for our Digital publishing brand. We are based out of San Jose, California and we are launching an Internet marketing brand that teaches people how to create sales funnels and build profitable online businesses which will give them a lifestyle of freedom and fun. We will accomplish this by providing high level training & tools distributed through product launches, coaching, masterminds, services and we have a monthly reoccurring plan so the money comes in month after month. Every sixty days we will launch a digital product. These products can be software based or information based giving our audience the tools and training they need to grow their established businesses or start new ventures. These product launches have huge potential or revenue and more information can be shared with the right investor. We will also partner up with other marketers who have ideas and products but just don't know how to bring their product to market. We will launch the product for them under our brand and by doing this we will gain more buyers on our list and revenue in the future. We currently work with business and entrepreneurs who want to have a successful online brand or generate more leads to their businesses. We have grown huge communities through Facebook marketing and currently market products on Facebook. With our knowledge we have decided to launch a new brand and that's why we are seeking an investor to join us so we can scale up quickly. If you ever wanted a piece of a digital publishing model then this is your opportunity. We would like to work with a local investor if possible. If you reply to this email I can provide you additional details of the amount we are seeking with the huge upside of investing with us.","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:01:34-0700","subCategory":{"category":"financial services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fns/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.348300","longitude":"-121.984400","info":""}}
