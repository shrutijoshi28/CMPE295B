To begin we need a picture of your special pet. Drawn freehand by the well renounced Artist Lory Ortega. Her art is so graphically stunning that she has been invited to do surgical images in medical books because of her uncanny ability to capture detail with the naked eye. Lory will hand craft your Pet Portrait Card in colored pencil or water color on acid free paper. Pet Portrait Cards begin at $89 for a 5 x 7 and $149 for an 8 x 10. All Pet Portrait Cards are autographed and dated by the artist for authenticity. You will enjoy the work of art for years to come. We look forward to receiving your order and answering any questions you may have.
