{"id":"4493096773","adHeader":"Real Photographers DO NOT Sell RAW Files","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/crs/4493096773.html","adDetails":"\"The rates for professional photographers advertising in Craigslist vary with a wide range anywhere from $100 per hour to $250 per hour with many photographers charging a minimum setup fee to shoot on location. Some photographers may even charge much more depending on the type of project. After accounting for the editing, their expensive equipment and their extensive training, the rates of pro photographers are a bargain when compared to the rates of professionals in other media and entertainment fields. The fee per hour usually includes editing of the photos but no prints. Some people do not realize the many hours it takes to enhance the photos through editing. So the hourly rate is not just for the coverage of the event or project. There are some shooters who may charge less than the average but these people rarely deliver optimal results and are not really professional photographers. Do not fall into the trap of hiring a moonlighter instead of a true professional photographer. The rate of dissatisfaction of hiring untrained or starting photographers is extremely high. If you cannot afford a pro photographer it would be better to ask a friend or relative to do the photography for you. This way you will not get professional results but at least you will not waste your money.\" -from a random CL ad. Personally, it took me about: 5 years of intense 14-hours-a-day study; over 27 years total interest; $18.000 in equipment, (in which my Canon 1D alone was $9999). I still learn new things every day and find large knowledge gaps to fill (megarays, light-field theory, QED). I am in high demand and my art images have won awards and been exhibited across the world. I have even recently had a local gallery solicit me instead of the other way around, so I would like to think I know a bit about what I am ranting about, despite the negativity. I am not an expert, but I do, I create, and I teach. Sorry I can't be more tactful about this subject right now :( ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ At any rate, here are some rants I have been mulling over regarding the poor and uninspired work of most of my CL colleagues and the weirdo CL ads by people wanting veteran expert photographers but paying dirt-digger wages: 1. Stop requesting both video and stills. This is two different kinds of shoots and if you make the photog do both the results will suffer and I don't care who it is. Martin Scorsese doesn't whip out a Canon 5dm3 and start snapping stills of Deniro while he's filming DiCaprio with a motion camera on a rail. What? Are you people literally insane? Hire two separate people, a videographer and a still photog. Believe in your product or art enough to invest pro-level money into it, because IT WILL make a difference. This does not include clever studios that incorporate two great shooters onto one bidded job; this is a fantastic idea/method, but of course, it costs. 2. Stop looking for students and moonlighters or a guy with just a good camera. The results will be capital S, H, blank-blank..... If I knew a product I was going to buy had such little though or care put into it that they used a budget moonlighter iPhone photog, then forget that product. If I look at body piercings online, and I see a camera phone reflected in the jewelry, I immediately leave the site. Who cares about a product if the creator can't even be bothered to respect his own creation enough to document it properly? I mean, if your car breaks down, which mechanic do you hire: A nervous teenager with a brand new Craftsman set of wrenches, or a guy with dirty Snap-on tools and 20 years experience, a list of reviews and references, and accordingly-priced rates? If you owned an airplane and flew your family, would you let the eager student with a manual and a blank notepad work on the engine, or the guy that flew in Viet Nam in '69 and kept helicopters repaired on-the-fly-and-under-fire? Probably the twitchy Nam guy, right, regardless of how quirky this individual is. So yes, it can start with the tools, but with photography the camera is just that. It is the tool that captures a recording of the light and instead it is the PERSON and their skill and experience that really makes the image. 3. When a REAL photographer shoots, they shoot with a Canon 1d, 5d, 6d, 7d or a Nikon 800 or 800E with PRIME LENSES all under f2.8 (none of that fakey f4 24-105 and definitely not a crap-sensor camera mounted with a laughable EFS 18-55 kit lens.) It is true that a great artist can make images with a home-made pinhole camera, but I know a photographer is serious about their craft and have done their homework when they show up with gear like I mentioned. Images and File Formats: The images themselves, when done by a real pro, are shot in a format called RAW, which cannot even be read without a special program installed on a laptop or phone. A RAW image has up to 32-bit color and is hundreds of MB of info (at least it is on my Canon 1d, 5d and 6d.) A jpeg version, on the other hand, is 8-bit and 11mb. You are the client? Well...you will probably get full size jpeg, PERIOD. If you pay more, however, then maybe a 16-bit TIFF(appx 80mb) or lossless PNG, but NEVER NEVER NEVER that RAW file without a contract and a serious investment. The larger the file is the longer I have to wait on my computer to organize, develop, and process. Personally, I have to feel as if my images are 110% to my satisfaction, or I will do a full refund and walk. I call this integrity, and it works for me. I will not be rushed or given ultimatums. I expect professionalism, and just as I do not charge extra for emergencies or last-minute problems on the client's end, I expect the same in return. I do not expect to be taken advantage of during times when I am short on petty cash and you try to manipulate that to get extra work. So what is a RAW file/ RAW negative? A RAW file is a file we real professional photographers call our negative (regarding digital photography vs film). -It has always been this rule for as long as photography has been around: In no manner or way can you obtain a negative without paying thousand of dollars for the ownership of said negative, and you will be considered fortunate to even be allowed to view the negatives, because this is where all of a photog's mistakes are. (For example, I might shoot 30 images in one hour and use 28 of them. Some other pros may shoot 500 in that same hour and use, heh, 28 of them. Most attempt to get that perfect shot by shooting continuous, which is fine, but then they often hide the negatives because clients perceive a lot of throwaway shots as mistakes. I have had colleagues tell me they have lost business over this. Is one style better than the other? I don't think so, but clients seem to.) When I shoot, I shoot RAW and I put my RAW negatives on an external HD, inaccessible to hackers or thieves. I will only consider selling RAW for a minimum of $1000 and that is for 1-5 portrait images. I have many clients shrug and easily pay this, while I still retain copyright. No well-known artist or photographer in their right mind would willingly surrender copyright and ownership. They will at most just sell the usage of the individual image, and restrict that further to size, crop, etc. If you, as the client feel you can demand ownership and copyright? Oh, gosh, no. Never. Never. Well, not for a minimum of $1,000 or so per image, and a contract written by my lawyer. Expect to pay a minimum of $40k for the full usage of the material, with a long contract of do's and don't's. When Stephen King writes a new book, does he have to give up the paper it's written on and transfer the whole ownership of the work to the publisher? I. Don't. Think. So. He sells the publishing rights of a copy of that original work for a set time at a set price but he still \"owns\" the original work. What would happen if you went to Peter Jackson and said \"Yeah, well.....um....how about you don't get paid for the Hobbit movies, but you get to tell people that it was you that made it....um....yeah.....You can put Hobbit in your portfolio, but we own the movie and the actual negatives.....\" You, madam or sir, can just get right the F... out!
