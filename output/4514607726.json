Some people ask, \"What do you mean by 'helping people get out of college.'\" If you are enrolled but haven't graduated yet, then you have yet to discover the ancient academic tradition of \"REGISTRAR TORTURE.\" Completing the coursework is only PART of the college experience. The rest involves navigating the administrative traps that await you before they actually give you your diploma. Ask around - they'll tell you. I learned about it at Rhodes College and The University of Michigan, where I did my B.A. and M.A. Graduating from Rhodes College didn't make me a Rhodes Scholar - I'm a ROGUE Scholar. I live in Berkeley, and am also available for meetings at the SF Public Library near the Civic Center. Also, I can meet with you anywhere along the BART line. All services are billed by the hour. Be advised that academic whores maintain integrity. I WILL NOT DO YOUR WORK FOR YOU! But I will lead you through the process that can help make all of your academic work more accessible, and less intimidating in the future. I'll teach you how to fish, but I won't fish for you.

Scott Prosterman show contact info I never became an actual \"Rhodes Scholar\", but I attained standing as a \"Rogue Scholar\" many times over. \"I help them get in; I help them get out.\"","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:50:38-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.873800","longitude":"-122.254900","info":""}}
