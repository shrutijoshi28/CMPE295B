How do we get the most out of our time \"in the woodshed\" w/ our bass? My teaching methods are unique, and I guarantee you'll improve as a bassist no matter how long you've been playing. * You'll learn how to improvise and create your own basslines, and how they interact with chords and rhythms. The emphasis of my teaching will be placed on understanding and using your musical knowledge to be as creative as you can possibly be. * In a short while, you'll be able to figure out basslines from your favorite CD's, recognize the patterns and/or scales they came from, and have enough knowledge of musical theory to modify them and make them your own. * Each lesson is custom designed for the student. I emphasize visual learning systems for scales and modes. If you have any confidence or performance anxiety issues, we'll totally \"go there.\" Progress can certainly be made. * I'm willing to take all levels of players and have over 30 active students at any given time. Beginners - the only thing I ask is that you be as serious about learning to be a good bassist and willing to put in the practice between lessons. * My rates are reasonable and I have a flexible schedule. I have a BA in Music composition, performance & production. All lessons can be worked into the times that are the most convenient for you. (Mon-Sat) * I teach both @ my home studio (close to Bart, always parking) and online on Skype * I'll be happy to provide you with references of current students. You can talk to someone already taking lessons from me. I encourage you to do this. * Please email, text or call show contact info to discuss your needs. Thank you for reading this, and I hope to hear from you soon.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:16:50-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
