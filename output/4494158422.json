While there is no shortage of web design companies eager to build your new website, not all are created equal. Our website package is designed to provide you with not only a great looking website, but also the customer service and support you need to get your site launched and integrated with the latest components for marketing, including email marketing, social networking setup and integration, blogging, search engine optimization, video creation, and more. You can basically sit back and relax as your online campaign begins to take shape. Most importantly, this website package and the technology behind it has been slowly refined over the course of building hundreds of small business websites for customers in many different industries, from all over the country. To the small business owner, this means the process is simplified and requires very little work from you. Outside of basically agreeing to get started and filling out an initial questionnaire, there isn't much we need from you, outside of feedback during the design process. If you have an existing website, this process is even more simplified as we can pull the content from your old website that is still relevant, and transfer it over to your new design. If you are starting from scratch, we will give you guidance for creating website content, and can even have the content written for you. Once the design and content is finalized and your site is ready for launch, there are a number of tasks that need attention, some of which you may not even realize, and this is what separates our website package from a quick, less expensive option another web design firm might provide. Building and managing a website is a time consuming process, and for this reason we budget the time up front to do things like onsite search engine optimization, hooking up programs to measure traffic, design an email marketing template, produce a company profile video, and more. If you are going to market your business online, you might as well do it right, and our website package at bizdetail is about first laying a foundation that will last your business for years to come, and then providing you the service to maintain it.

If you have an existing site or your content is ready to go, it is completely possible to launch before the end of month 1. .

Month three is about bringing everything together so that your online marketing platform is firing on all cylinders.
