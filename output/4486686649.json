Some people know a few pentatonic scales. Some people know a few major scales. Some people are mislead to think that you need to learn to read music/be classically trained to learn scales. That's not the case, especially in context of playing modern music. (as opposed to classical) Many, many resources and people/teachers seem to teach the fretboard poorly. Playing \"scale x @ fret y\" and mastering pentatonic +maj/min +modes is not as hard as it seems. I emphasize an all-visual system. You'll never have to learn each scale as an autonomous concept. It's something I teach a lot and teach efficiently. I teach general guitar as well if you want to \"do playing stuff\" while we work on scales.... very flexible. I am available Mon-Sat. I have a BA in music composition, performance and production. This has been my \"day job\"/vocation for about 10 years and I love it. Lessons are available @ my studio or on Skype/online. I'm used to being a guitar/bass \"psychologist\" as needed... help with practice habits, performance anxiety/on the spot, not falling into the same patterns, mental blocks. Wherever you're @ we'll play fill in the blanks and address \"bad habits\" that come up in the process. Thanks so much for your time. I hope to hear from you soon. show contact info (email may ensure the most prompt, efficient response)","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:50:25-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.870825","longitude":"-122.277880","info":"University at McGee "}}
