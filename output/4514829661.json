{"id":"4514829661","adHeader":"14 Years of PR, Writing, Editing Experience For Sony, YMCA Numi Tea","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/crs/4514829661.html","adDetails":"I am looking to pick up additional clients for writing, proofreading or PR services, or a combination of all three elements. I write, edit and conduct PR for large companies, as well as individual and small business clients, who come to me on a project basis. Additionally, I work with students on a project basis, but only for editing and providing feedback for what they have written. I do not write any essays, papers, etc. for students, and work with students only from a proofreading and editing standpoint. I also have helped out with college admission letters, but only once they are in the editing stage. I have a business license and a network of media contacts, from Bay Area newspapers to nationwide magazines, and have many media and client references I can provide interested parties. I also have several on-call admins who support me as needed. I have covered a variety of industries in my writing and PR work, including real estate, non-profit, video games, electronics, consumer tech, financial and more. I was a published journalist for three Bay Area newspapers before starting my career in PR, and I simultaneously had writing and editing clients while working in PR, before starting my business six years ago. A few areas of my expertise include special events, press releases, press conferences, press tours, marketing collateral, Web marketing research, marketing and PR plans. I have garnered press for my clients in more than 200 newspapers, websites, radio stations and broadcast stations, including coverage in the New York Times, USA Today, Palo Alto Daily, Palo Alto Weekly, Bay Area Parent, San Jose Mercury News, Maxim, Elle, Disney Adventures, Cookie Magazine, National Geographic Kids, and countless others. The best project for me is one where you can retain me on a set amount of hours per week or month so I can help you grow your new business or revitalize your existing business or products, or you need my services with a one-time project, where you may come back occasionally for future opportunities. What sets me apart from anyone else in this field is my extensive established media relationships, knowledge of PR, excellent writing and editing skills, and strategic mind. I won't tell you what you want to hear, I will tell you what you NEED to hear in order for you to maximize your visibility, improve your written materials, and stand out if you're an individual seeking a job in this tough economy. My writing rates are $50/hour, proofreading is $45, and PR rates are determined by the scope of the project - either hourly or by monthly retainer. Contact me today with the details of your needs!","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:59:42-0700","subCategory":{"category":"creative services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/crs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.429069","longitude":"-122.139130","info":""}}
