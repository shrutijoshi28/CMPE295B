Each person is unique and presents his/her own history. I have discovered that many people, children or adults, who are having trouble academically, are having trouble emotionally. That is why I value my skills as both a counselor and a tutor. My first session is a half hour meet and greet for free. I charge $50/hour. If you want a twice per week schedule, the rate drops to $45/hour.
