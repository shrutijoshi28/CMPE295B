By appointment only. email: info (at) friscovintage.com Thinking about getting that vintage Vespa back on the road? I can help you. Let's get your Vespa project rolling. Motorcycle shops charge $100/hr. for labor. I'll do it for less. I have almost 30 years of experience and all the tools. I specialize in P-series, but could probably help with any large-frame, two-stroke Vespa. Check out my reviews on Yelp! tune-ups brakes clutch cables tire changes carb rebuilds electrical engine rebuilds no job too small Drop me a line and I'm sure we can work out a deal you'll be happy with. If I can't fix it, you don't pay. To state the obvious: I don't do Lambretta. If your scooter is automatic, plastic, or doesn't say Vespa on it....I can't help you. I don't work on mopeds of any type, or brand. No go-peds. No mini-bikes. No motorized skateboards. If it's not a two-stroke, metal, manual-shift Vespa scooter then I DON'T work on it. I do not like green eggs and ham. BUT,....on the off-chance you have a two-stroke Stella, 60s/70s Bajaj, or an Allstate (Sears-branded 60s Vespa) I may still be able to help you. They are essentially Vespa clones. I reserve the right to reject any Vietnamese/Asian Vespa \"restorations\".","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:38:21-0700","subCategory":{"category":"cycle services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/cys/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
