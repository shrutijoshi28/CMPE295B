I am a former journalist with a Bachelor's in English from San Jose State University and a minor in journalism. I have written everything from professional bios and corporate overviews to product fact sheets and press releases. I've also written and edited resumes and cover letters that have garnered results - jobs! Whether you are looking for someone to write or proofread your Web site copy, create or edit text for a company newsletter, contribute to a bylined article or even write or critique and revise your cover letter and resume, you've come to the right person (and writer)! The great thing about being a writer/proofreader is the ability to be a generalist and write about anything - I've written and edited items in more than 25 genres, including food, technology, interior design, real estate, retail, chiropractic care, internet security, video games, cosmetics, nonprofits - just to name a few industries. My diverse background is unique, and the work that I do is proof of that. My rates are $50/hour for writing, $45/hour for proofreading. This is competitive pricing based on my experience - how many writers do you know who have written pitch letters and caught the attention of the New York Times, San Jose Mercury News, Disney Adventures, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Latina Magazine, Maxim, Stuff and more? Don't let a typo or grammatical error make a lasting impression!","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:04:46-0700","subCategory":{"category":"writing/editing/translation","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/wet/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.324305","longitude":"-121.977081","info":""}}
