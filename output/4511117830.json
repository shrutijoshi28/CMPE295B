I scored at the top one percentile on the official GMAT and can help you raise your score to the level required by the business schools of your choice. With my service you get someone more qualified than a mass-production GMAT prep company tutor at a fraction of the cost. Plus I am more highly incentivized to help you succeed because I am not working for a company who takes 80% of what you are being billed for. I have almost a decade of private tutoring and classroom teaching experience, so I'm not one of those people who only knows the content but not how to communicate it. In fact, Chicago Public Schools hired me to design the curricula for Algebra, Trigonometry, Precalculus, and AP Calculus (my syllabus being approved by the College Board). No matter where you are in the spectrum, I will help you move up in a friendly, supportive, and patient way! Credentials -Proofread economic models for Booth School of Business -Education Consultant for the Chicago Public Schools -Taught honors and AP Calculus in a classroom setting -ISACS New Teacher Institute Certified -Twice taught elementary and middle school teachers math Under University of Chicago's VIGRE program -Reviewed NASA educational materials If you would like to learn more about my service and background, check out my website!
