{"id":"4499721368","adHeader":"Concrete/Cement/Sidewalk - Crack & Lippage Repair - Drainage Channels","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sks/4499721368.html","adDetails":"Did you get a letter from the city stating \"Notice To Repair Sidewalk\"? Did you find white spots spray painted on your sidewalk with your notice? I have a tool with a \"V'\" shaped diamond cutting wheel, called a \"crack chaser\" that i can run down any cracks in your sidewalk. This tool creates a clean \"V\" shaped slot that i will then fill with fast drying cement for a very reasonable price. This tool can also be used to create channels to \"direct\" water drainage. I also have a diamond grinder that can be used to bevel, level, flatten and/or smooth down any lippage or trip hazards. No permit from the city is necessary for these types of repair. No slab removal and/or replacement offered. You need a permit for this type of work and i would prefer not to have to deal with the city. I am interested in small jobs only! References and examples of past jobs available. Pay me AFTER completion to your satisfaction! 29 years stone experience. I also have the ability to cut, drill and polish concrete, marble and granite. Please include your phone number in your response. Send a picture if you can.","postDate":"2014-06-11T00:06:31-0700","subCategory":{"category":"skilled trade services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sks/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
