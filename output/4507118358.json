I teach students of all levels and ages. I love working with children as well as adults, whether they have professional aspirations or simply want to pursue music as a hobby. I have a master's degree in piano performance, and I am currently finishing a master's degree in vocal performance from the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. I am a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher, and I desire to help every student develop a love of music and become the very best they can be. I believe in working toward goals that will bring each individual student satisfaction and accomplishment. I have helped many students prepare for the ABRSM exams (the graded assessment tests set by the Royal Academy of Music). I have also taught college music theory and ear-training classes.
