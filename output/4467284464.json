I am now totally spoiled on the convenience of having Joe come to the office to help us stay on track. He does a great job keeping the corporate \"Golden Girls\" in line (we really are a handful). The group sessions keep us all accountable to each other and Joe has been super-dependable and always prepared to cajole and encourage us. His workouts are flexible and fun; Joe is a great coach to get us to try new things and push harder than before.\" http://www.joepft.com/testimonials.html","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:59:15-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.268500","longitude":"-121.849000","info":""}}
