I can help restore peace in your household, and sanity in your mind. And help you cut through the clutter! Whatever it is that is keeping you from going through the clutter, contact me so that you can keep the things you need, and get rid of the items cluttering up your house (and mind). I am also a wealth of resources to help you once you've gathered a pile of items to be discarded from your home. I work throughout the South Bay, up to the Peninsula. $100 for a 3-hour session, $25 each additional hour. I am currently scheduling appointments for the week of June 15th.","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:38:29-0700","subCategory":{"category":"household services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/hss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.261211","longitude":"-121.960012","info":""}}
