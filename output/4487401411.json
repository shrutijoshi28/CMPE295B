{"id":"4487401411","adHeader":"MOVING AND PICK UP TRUCK DELIVERY","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/lbs/4487401411.html","adDetails":"I own a pickup truck (toyota tacoma), and also an enclosed trailer 6'x12', if you are moving short or long distance, or if you buying in IKEA, COSTCO, CRAIGSLIST, BEST BUY, or any other furniture store. RAIN OR SHINE, I can help you haul it. You don't have to rent a uhaul truck and pay a bunch of fees. My truck is very clean (I don't haul any trash or greasy stuff).You would get my help and my truck to load and unload your stuff, you won't pay for gas, I have ratchetable straps, tie downs, and blankets to secure your items. My rates are very affordable. I AM FLEXIBLE AND AN EASY GOING PERSON. All you have to do is give me a call at show contact info. My name is IGNACIO. THANKS.","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:27:40-0700","subCategory":{"category":"labor & moving","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lbs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.403100","longitude":"-121.858500","info":""}}
