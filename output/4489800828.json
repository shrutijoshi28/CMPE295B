My experience includes training at 24 hour fitness for a year and independently for 3 years and coaching collegiate track and field for the past 3 years. I have certifications in NCSF, ISSA, USA Track & Field, and CPR. Your training will include a schedule for the month, varied work outs for your goal and help with your diet. You get 3, 1 hour personal training sessions a week, each month my prices are a fraction of what you would get at the gym and for a more complete service and more flexible schedule. 1st session is free.
