I had always loved the idea of fire dancers, but had never seen them live and did not really know what to expect. The Aries dancers were absolutely phenomenal. They created two beautifully choreographed sets that were mesmerizingly beautiful and at times jaw dropping. They selected a great mix of music and their costumes only enhanced the mood. My guests were completely blown away by the performances and everyone was talking about them for weeks after. In addition, the dancers were extremely professional and genuinely warm and friendly people. They were a pleasure to work with and I cannot recommend them more highly!\" ~Alison, married in Mendocino August 2013","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:06:30-0700","subCategory":{"category":"event services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/evs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"38.482200","longitude":"-122.747300","info":""}}
