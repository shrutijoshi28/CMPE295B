As I get close to retirement in my trade(hvac) I've decided to see if I can use my experience to help others who appreciate the early bikes and work at something I really enjoy.I think the air-cooled bikes of the early days are still the best looking and the most true motorcycles.I'm looking to help you fix up your old bike or restore a classic. can powder coat your parts or frame or fabricate what you may need. Pre 80's bikes are my specialty.can do whatever welding you may need as well. give me a call.
