Learning to play the piano is a life skill that can really enrich one's life. It is my goal that all students truly enjoy playing the piano and look forward to each lesson. I try to provide a solid musical foundation and help my students to define and accomplish their goals with the student's ongoing enjoyment of making music as a top priority. I believe that only by being sensitive to each student needs, and abilities, and working steadily with a program that's tailored to each individual student, true progress can be made. I believe that learning is best attained in a relaxed, supportive environment with good communication between student and teacher.
