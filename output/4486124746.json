I focus on performance, improvisation and theory using grids, TAB, and traditional notation. Every lesson is documented with clear and specific instructions geared towards each student's level of study. I've been teaching since 1978 and have instructed over 1,500 successful guitar students at The Musicians Warehouse San Jose, Tony's Music San Jose, and Steven's Music Cupertino; of which many of whom have gone on to become professional guitarists themselves. Currently I teach in my home studio located in Almaden. It's a quiet and peaceful environment and there are never any distractions that the student may find from taking lessons in a noisy retail music store. Educational background: I have a Master's Degree in Music from San Jose State University (B.A. Class of '82, M.A. Class of '93) and have studied privately with Gregory Yasinitsky (currently Professor of Music and Coordinator of Jazz Studies at Washington State University), David Costa (prodigious student of the great jazz guitarist Warren Nunes), Dwight Cannon (former Director of Jazz Studies at San Jose State University), Hafez Modirzadeh (currently a Professor of Music at San Francisco State University), Joe Davis (former Director of Jazz Studies at West Valley College), Tom Hart (former Director of Jazz Studies at De Anza College) and jazz piano virtuoso Don Haas. Professional background: I've been active since 1974 as a solo artist and leader/sideman with an assortment of ensembles ranging from duos to 19 piece orchestras throughout Northern California and the west coast. I've produced and released 4 CDs under my band's name of SPF. SPF/Island in the Sound 2002, SPF/Another Conversation With Myself 2005, 2008, SPF/III 2010, SPF/eclecticCovers 2012 all available at iTunes, CD Baby and Amazon.com.
