Do you want your finished product to be filled with your values, express your viewpoint? I'm Pat Sullivan, and I'd be honored to help you meet your unique business, nonprofit or personal needs. My writing credits include columns in the San Francisco Chronicle, books, articles, bankable business plans, legal and technical documents. My specialty is helping people like you quickly become clear about your message, who wants to hear it, and why. You determine how much assistance you want, from editing an almost-done document to researching and writing everything for you. WHAT ARE YOUR NEEDS AND DREAMS? I'm listening at show contact info. SUMMARY OF WRITING EXPERIENCE BUSINESS PLAN WRITING: The first business plan I ever wrote got a photographer the funds she needed to quit her day job and open a thriving studio. That plan became a bank's model for how to write a business plan and led to my teaching about a dozen business plan classes for the SBA. For a free article on how to create a sustainable, ethical business, just call or write. BOOK PROPOSAL WRITING: A book proposal is basically a business plan, and my first one generated a book contract and advance. Using some exciting proprietary techniques, I can help you quickly shape your book idea and outline. Perhaps, as I did for one client, I can write your sample chapters and an outline. COLUMNS: My \"Vision and Values\" column ran for two years in the career section of the San Francisco Chronicle (formerly the combined Examiner & Chronicle). It's now being published as a timely and timeless collection of tips and inspiration for people from all faiths, all fields, all levels of the corporate or nonprofit job ladder. The \"Practical Spirituality\" column for the babyboomer portal, www.myprimetime.com, which ran for one year, taught me how to grab attention and provide useful information in 250 words or less. ARTICLE WRITING: I've ghosted an article for Psychology Today for a therapist and written many articles and columns under my own name. Venues include a magazine for the American Bar Association, several legal newspapers, California Job Journal, and the journal of the Institute for Noetic Sciences. LEGAL AND TECHNICAL WRITING: I've helped edit a book on American law for Japanese businesspeople and drafted many legal pleadings.","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:31:40-0700","subCategory":{"category":"writing/editing/translation","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/wet/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
