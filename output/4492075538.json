RAIN or SHINE, I can help you to haul your stuff. You don't have to rent a uhaul truck and pay a bunch of fees. I have a very clean truck (I don't haul any dirt or construction debris). You would get my help and my truck to load and unload your stuff, you won't pay for gas, I have ratchetable straps, tie downs, and blankets to secure your items. My rate starts at $40 for local hauling. I AM FLEXIBLE AND AN EASY GOING PERSON. All you have to do is give me a call at show contact info. My name is IGNACIO. THANKS.","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:20:23-0700","subCategory":{"category":"labor & moving","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lbs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.388600","longitude":"-122.017700","info":""}}
