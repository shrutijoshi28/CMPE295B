{"id":"4483010061","adHeader":"QuarterLife Coaching","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/crs/4483010061.html","adDetails":"Greetings, My name is Dr. Dan and for more than a decade, I've worked as a counselor, psychologist, therapist, peer-advisor, and coach in the service of mental and emotional health and wellbeing. In the course of receiving my Bachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies, my Masters in Transpersonal Psychology, and my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology, I've worked with a diversity of populations, including adolescents, adults, and elders, in the context of a group, a couple, a family and as individuals. Since 2010, my work has focused primarily with those individuals between the ages of roughly 25 and 35, struggling with meaning and purpose, work/life balance, intimacy and fulfillment in relationships, and spiritual challenges. Considered holistically, I refer to this constellation of issues as the QuarterLife Crisis and it is actually a common and potentially beneficial phase of adult development. Unfortunately, few if any pertinent resources are available to help folks navigate this confusing yet transformative period of life. While I've worked with a wide range of clinical disorders, this QuarterLife Coaching work focuses primarily on mild to moderate stress, anxiety, and depression. After only a few sessions, you will see positive results around relationship issues, career and work fulfillment, personal organization, time management, and a new beginning towards a healthy lifestyle balance which nourishes your mind, body, and spirit. Call today for your free telephone consultation and ask about my sliding scale. show contact info","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:52:23-0700","subCategory":{"category":"creative services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/crs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.797298","longitude":"-122.433847","info":"Union Street at Webster Street "}}
