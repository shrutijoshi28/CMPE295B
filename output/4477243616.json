I offer private math tutoring in Algebra 1 and 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, Precalc, Math Analysis and Calculus AB or BC to all students in this area. I was also a math tutor at an adult education center and am comfortable working with adults too. If you need to improve your math skills and/or are taking your GED, CBEST or GRE exam, I can help you too. My hourly rate is $40 an hour at my home or yours. Please email me for references, or for more information.","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:36:32-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
