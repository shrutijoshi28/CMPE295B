Deer fencing done improperly & cheaply looks terrible & is also unsafe for deer. Keep the beautiful unobstructed view of the rolling hills, oaks, open space, wildlife & beautiful views of Mt. Diablo that we all love without comproming the security of your home, & your landscaping will thank you as well. Just because it's for the deer & garden doesn't mean it can't be for you, so don't lose your view. Please see below, and visit our website, for numerous examples of our quality fencing. show contact info show contact info http://www.craigfencing.com/","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:43:41-0700","subCategory":{"category":"farm & garden services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fgs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.896100","longitude":"-122.111900","info":""}}
