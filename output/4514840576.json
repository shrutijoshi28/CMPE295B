I am extremely organized. Prior to starting my own business in 2008, I worked for a large electronics corporate company for 6 years, and worked at a PR agency and newspaper before that. I have a flexible schedule because my business is based at home, and I own my car (SUV) outright. I can start as early as 8 a.m., and work as late as 9-10 p.m., since the projects for my business clients are flexible, and I sometimes work late at night or on weekends to complete them before deadline.
