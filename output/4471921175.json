For the past twenty plus years I've been creating high end graphics and effects for national tv commercials. Now out of the rat race, I specialize in logo and identity design, digital illustration, graphic design, photo manipulation, color correction and retouching. As well as, product, interior and character design. I know the questions to ask in order to deliver a quality product that's on time and on budget. I'm passionate about the creative process so there's no project to big or to small. Other services include art & creative direction for the film, advertising and interior design industries.
