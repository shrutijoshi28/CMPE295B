The finished product will be dependent on the shooting schedule. Please contact us at ( 4 0 8 ) 4 7 6 - 9 2 5 4 to reserve a day and time to shoot your video. How much input do I have during the production process? We start brainstorming with you from our first discussion, and then ask you to provide whatever input/photos/resources you have at your disposal. If you would like to select your own stock photos if needed, we give you access to pick them out on your own. We also ask you to read over and approve the video script if you do not provide one, before the voice over for your video is produced. If you have a preference, we allow you to select the gender of your professional voice over. During the filming of your video, your assistance is useful and appreciated because it will help us achieve your vision. The more information you can provide to us in relation to what you are looking for, the better your final product will turn out. How else can I contribute to my video? Occasionally, we work with clients that would prefer to write their own script, or produce their own voice over. If this sounds like you, we will coordinate with you to get the job done. One word of warning, if you wish to record your own voice over, you will need a microphone. How is my video delivered? Your video will be uploaded to your YouTube channel. If you do not have a YouTube channel, one will be created for you. Once the video is uploaded to YouTube, you can download the original file. If you need it in another format, we will be happy to work with you. Where will filming take place? Filming will take place at a Bay Area location of your choice, for example your place of business or in the field. You will be responsible for all approval and permits for filming on location. If your place of business is outside of 65 miles of San Francisco, there will be additional travel expenses to be approved of by you before submitting your deposit.
