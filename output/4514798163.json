I've done service Plumbing for 2 years, light carpentry for 2 1/2 years and many other types of labor work along the way. I know trusting someone to do work for you is always something that is an unsure feeling. I can guarantee that I'm just here to offer service and be paid. I already have a full time job. Just want to pick up some side jobs, face it we do live in San Francisco after all, of which I am a native.I'm a really cool individual and easy to work with. It's all business and no games. Just let me know what you need done and we can discuss options.","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:04:54-0700","subCategory":{"category":"skilled trade services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sks/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
