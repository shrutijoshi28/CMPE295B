I have been working as an instructional aide in 1st grade for the past 2 years at Holy Family School in San Jose. I have a BA in English from Loyola Marymount University and have owned my own transcription/editing business prior to beginning work as an aide. I specialize in reading and writing for the K thru 5th grader. I have many books to share as motivation as well. I am a Mom also... I have two sons (aged 11 and 15) and have been fingerprinted through the Diocese of San Jose. I have a business license with the City of San Jose (N Major Business Services). I will challenge yor child, while providing fun activity and homework assignements. I suggest 1 hour to 2 hours per week in the summer. I like to meet at public locations, such as a local library. I charge reasonable rates... Finally, if you have a middle schooler that needs help with pre algebra/algebra/geometry, my teenage son is a straight A, advanced math student at Pioneer High School and can assist with any math tutoring. I am located int he Willow Glen/Cambrian area of San Jose, but am willing to travel anywhere within the Santa Clara County. I charge $60 per hour, and I bill twice per month. If you are interested in seeing your child reach his/her fullest potential, please contact me with your child's age, grade level, specific tutoring needs, and a phone number.","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:21:40-0700","subCategory":{"category":"small biz ads","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/biz/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.256800","longitude":"-121.889600","info":""}}
