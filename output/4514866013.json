{"id":"4514866013","adHeader":"Paella Catering!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/evs/4514866013.html","adDetails":"Looking for that special dish for your next party, event, or gathering? How about paella? Paella is a Spanish dish prepared by simmering together chicken, chorizo sausage, seafood, rice, vegetables, and saffron with other seasonings. I can prepare a vegetarian version as well, using soy-based chicken and seafood substitutes. Price depends on number of people and the choices of chicken and seafood desired, but it's generally between $20 and $25 per person. I can serve up to 20 people with the pan and burner-ring I have. I arrive early, set up, and prepare the meal either while your guests watch or prior to their arrival so that you're ready to serve soon after the event starts. Setup and preparation take about 2 hours. After serving, I clean up my preparation area, provide you with the leftovers, then leave you to your party. I am not in the catering business, but enjoy making this dish for friends, family, winery release parties, and now for you and your private party. Homemade cheesecakes in a variety of types available for dessert at about $25 apiece, with each serving about 10. Give it a try!","postDate":"2014-06-11T00:37:24-0700","subCategory":{"category":"event services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/evs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.918200","longitude":"-122.071700","info":""}}
