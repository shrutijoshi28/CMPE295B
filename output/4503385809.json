{"id":"4503385809","adHeader":"Spanish Tutoring -- Results Oriented and Reasonable Rates","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/lss/4503385809.html","adDetails":"I have a Masters degree in Spanish, and I lived and taught English in Madrid, Spain for four years. I taught Spanish at UCLA while getting my Masters there, and have taught and tutored Spanish elsewhere and independently for the past 20 years. I love Spanish and truly thrive on seeing people advance. (My first BA was in Sociology because I was originally going to become a Social Worker.) When I work with students as their tutor in Spanish, it really isn't \"hit or miss\" with me. I guarantee that, if you follow the instruction, I'll have you understand it and use it better, whether for your pleasure or your GPA. Because grammar and relating with people are two main interests of mine, I am especially strong in the analysis and/or explanation of grammar and in helping develop conversation. I generally charge $40.00 for a bit over 60 minutes. I am willing to travel reasonable distances. I have references. If you are interested, respond to this ad, please, or call show contact info (and leave your number, please). Thank you.","postDate":"2014-06-11T00:52:16-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
