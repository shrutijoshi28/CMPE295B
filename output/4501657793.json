CALL VITTORIO show contact info *** Hello, this is Vittorio. I have been in the painting business for the last 18 years, (COMMERCIAL & RESIDENTIAL), working for other contractors and offering my handyman services to direct clients. I offer a painting special of $99 per room (plus cost of paint) provided that there are no walls with too much preparation. Also all furniture must be removed, otherwise, an additional charge applies to remove or move furniture. This special is good for small rooms. Medium-large and large rooms will be charged according to estimate. My prices are very reasonable and I have great references from many satisfied customers. I am available 7 days a week. Special price for painting one small room.One coat and walls only.Paint is extra. Profecional painter.!!Larger rooms have an extra surcharge,still very reasonable! I am a nice person to deal with and you will notice that the minute you call me. I am also extremely neat & clean cut and I will leave absolutely no mess in your property. In fact, your property will be left looking brand new and smelling fresh and clean. I pay special attention to details and I love to apply my artistic touches to the work I do. (I am also an artist licensed by the city art commission). You will get a very professional work meticulously and impeccably done by a painter that knows that customer satisfaction comes absolutely first. Your full satisfaction and future referrals are worth much more to me than the money you will pay me. I am based in the outer Sunset District, close to Safeway store. Please, call me at show contact info for a quick, no hussle, friendly quote. Have a great day!
