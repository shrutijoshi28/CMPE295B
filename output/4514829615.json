THANK YOU! Alexis EXCELLENT REFERENCES....here's two current samples: \"Alexis is a real gem. She's friendly, reliable, conscientious, and trustworthy. I can't think of a better person to look after my pride and joy Australian Shepherd while I'm away on business. With Alexis I don't have to worry because I know my dog is in good hands. She is the consummate caretaker whether bringing my dog to the park to throw his ball, around town with her while running errands, or even baking him cookies. She's the best. \" Todd Campopiano, Berkeley I would highly recommend the Pet Grandma, Alexis. About four years ago we inherited a special needs cat. Our Sweetie aka Killer is very particular about the company we keep. The first time we needed to leave her home while we were away it was extremely stressful not knowing how she was going to react to a new Grandma. Alexis e-mailed us every day with a full report of animal behavior. So, at the end of a long days drive, we checked into our hotel and there was that e-mail. It gave us the peace of mind we needed for a good nights sleep. Now, when we want to get away we don't hesitate to just give Alexis a call and have a good trip knowing everything is under control at home.
