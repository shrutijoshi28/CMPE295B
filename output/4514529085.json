{"id":"4514529085","adHeader":"Private Chef & Health Coach","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/hss/4514529085.html","adDetails":"Greetings! Do you wish you had more time in your day to prepare both delicious and healthy meals for your family? Or more time for meal planning, recipe hunting, and grocery shopping? Maybe you are concerned with all the unnecessary, harmful additives in packaged and processed foods, and wish to eat healthier, but aren't sure how to prepare certain foods? Let me help you take control of your health! Whether you want food for a day, or several days' worth, I customize meals to your liking, and work with you in creating meals designed to meet your dietary and nutritional needs. Whether you enjoy seafood, Indian, Thai, Italian, vegetarian, gluten-free, BBQ, or just good ol' comfort food, I can create layers of flavor, or simply bring out the essence of a single food. I strive for simplicity, and use ingredients that are strictly fresh, local, and derived from little or no processing. Farmers markets and organics are always my first choice. I also incorporate knowledge of nutrition and proper food combining. In addition to busy professionals, my services are also ideal for: • Parents who want their children eating healthier • Expectant or new mothers • Folks who would like to lose weight or are diabetic • People with disabilities • Birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion dinner gatherings I have been a professional chef for over 15 years, and hold a California ServSafe Food Handler card. Currently I am studying Health Coaching with the Institute of Integrative Nutrition. Although I have learned from many mentors, my passion and intuition have led me to being mostly self-taught. Nothing rivals the satisfaction I feel after sharing the results of my creations with others! Other services I offer include: • Assistance in planning several days' worth of meals, including creative use of leftovers • Grocery shopping and clean-up (including composting) • Catering services for small parties (up to 20). I serve Santa Cruz County and the South Bay area, and offer affordable and flexible plans. Please call show contact info for more information. Happy eating!","postDate":"2014-06-10T17:51:12-0700","subCategory":{"category":"household services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/hss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
