Are you on SALARY and not receiving OVERTIME when you should ? ?","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lgs/4496264412.html","adDetails":"Are you on salary and not receiving Overtime Pay for working more than 8 hours in a day or over 40 in a week? If you answered yes to the above question, I would like to talk to you so that I may determine whether you should be receiving Overtime Pay. Remember that just because the employer puts you on salary doesn't mean that you are not entitled to Overtime Pay. California law assumes, until sufficiently rebutted, that ALL EMPLOYEES are entitled to be paid at 1.5 times their regular rate of pay (sometimes referred to as 'Overtime Pay' or 'OT') for all hours in excess of 8 per day or 40 per week. Employers often put workers on salary in order to deceive them into believing that they are no longer entitled to Overtime. HOWEVER, neither job title or salary determine eligibility to receive Overtime Pay. This determination is largely made based on the duties you perform (as laid out in California and federal statutes and Supreme Court case law), NOT on whether you are put on salary or how much that salary is. I am a licensed California attorney who can help you retrieve what you are owed. I have extensive knowledge of the California Labor Code and will ensure your rights are protected.
