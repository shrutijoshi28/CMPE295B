Music sets the tone of the event and Michael delivered a spectacular performance along with his violinist. He was easy to work with, he was responsive and incredibly talented. I still get chills from his music selection that my girls requested and how he made sure he learned the songs and executed them with perfection. He may have been the highlight of the weddings other than the brides of course... Outstanding!!!!\" -Cindi, July 2013 \"I love the harp with all my heart, so you can imagine how happy I was to know such a talented musician could play it for my wedding ceremony. He was so easy to work with and professional - and classy. I am so thankful I found Michael and he connected also with a violinist who played with him. I can't wait to hear them in the wedding video that will hopefully be coming my way soon... You won't be disappointed, and I'm a picky person - so that's saying a lot!!\" -Ellen, July 2013 \"Michael played for our wedding in April of 2011. He was awesome! The main thing that really stands out for me is Michael's professionalism. He really cares about preparing and getting it right! Very friendly, flexible and not pretentious. Oh, and his harp playing is fantastic also. I would not hesitate to recommend Michael to a friend for their wedding or any other event.\" -James, August 2011 \"Michael Steadman played at our June 2011 wedding in Oakland. We sent him a few requests beforehand, and he was able to take that and fill in as much similar, appropriate music as we needed. He was completely professional, had very reasonably prices, showed up on time, and played beautifully! We couldn't be happier!\" -Eliza, August 2011 \"Dear Mr. Steadman, I attended this wedding last weekend and wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your playing. I have never heard the Debussy Preludes played on anything other than the piano; your playing them on the harp was just beautiful.\" -Christine, July 2011 \"Michael played harp for our wedding ceremony at Shakespeare Garden in Golden Gate Park on June 18, 2011. Our guests loved Michael's performance during the ceremony. And we forever remembered how well his music pieces transitioned from each segment of our program seamlessly at exact time. Thank you, Michael for being there, and we truly appreciate your professionalism.\" -Lily, June 2011 \"Michael was very easy to work with. As I was planning the wedding we had a great discussion to review and select which music best suited our ceremony. And I had a special request, as well, which was for him to accompany my sister in singing a song she had arranged. He graciously agreed and it was beautiful, the day of our wedding, to see him help her through a sound check before the ceremony. ...I can't imagine a kinder or more courteous harpist than Michael. Our guests enjoyed his playing and had so many kind compliments for him. He was truly wonderful to have as part of our wedding!!\" -Coley, October 2010 \"Michael played for a reception May 8th, 2010. I was the coordinator. His arrival was prompt. His demeanor and attire were professional and dignified. His talent was amazing. I would definitely recommend that you call him for any formal affairs!!! He was pleasant about taking pictures and even helpful to me during the event. Excellent!!! I was completely impressed.\" -Tanya, July 2010 \"Michael was super easy to work with. I met with him in person and he was very helpful in recommending what music to play. You see I'm the groom and don't know a thing about wedding music. During our consultation I mentioned I was incorporating Chinese elements into the ceremony and he learned new music just to play for that time for us. The proof was that I got a lot of compliments after the ceremony. Thank you Michael!\" -Herman, June 2010 \"Michael performed at my wedding, during dinner, and he did a beautiful job! He was dressed for the occasion, polite, and very professional when doing business, especially since we did everything over e-mail and postal. He is trustworthy and keeps his word. Plus, as a bride on a strict budget, we were able to work out with payments. I highly recommend him for any special event. He is professional, trustful and his skills as a harpist are beautiful.\" -Michelle, January 2010 \"I was hiring someone to play my brother's wedding, and I, being a professional musician with experience in the wedding biz, wanted to find someone who knew what he/she was doing. Michael was all that and then some. He knew exactly how to accommodate our budget, the small space we were using, and style of ceremony. The music was so beautiful, and added so much to the special day. I'd definitely hire Michael again in the future.\" -Eryn, November 2009 \"Michael, you played beautifully at our wedding and our guests thought you were incredible!\" -Tivonna, October 2009 \"Michael played for our wedding in the Presidio, at the Chapel of Our Lady in September. Because this chapel doesn't have a piano the harp was the perfect solution for our wedding. It set a lovely mood and he brought an amplifier to help with sound. It worked out perfectly. He has incredible skill as a musician and offered great suggestions for the pieces at the wedding. Very professional, responsive and extremely polite!\" -Andrea, October 2009 \"Michael's playing was the perfect addition to an otherwise simple, no frills wedding. Not to sound superficial, but he really looked the part. He had a beautiful harp, and he is a handsome guy in a nice suit. Just right for a wedding. He was on time, played what we agreed on, and was right on cue. We didn't even have a rehearsal, so I was really relying on him and the minister to know what they were doing. I highly recommend him.\" -Laura, March 2009 -- PLEASE EMAIL FOR PRICING AND AVAILABILITY --","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:02:28-0700","subCategory":{"category":"event services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/evs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.758700","longitude":"-122.433000","info":""}}
