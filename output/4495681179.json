I repair any computer issues you may have. I repeat \" ANY \". My charges are way more less than the other though i work from my home.

Only then i just charge for my time because i also have to manage my time for my studies. \"MY CHARGES ARE REASONABLE I DON'T CHARGE LIKE OTHER\". Peoples always feel much happy with my service. So they usually pay me more. Even i don't ask them. ++ \" THERE IS NO CHARGES FOR DIAGNOSIS. FIRST I PREFER MY CUSTOMER 101% SATISFACTION AFTER THAT MONEY \" ++ Typically I can have most repairs done within a few hours I have all the spare parts plus i work from my home.

Your privacy is 101% guaranteed. Thank you so much for looking at my ad. You have a great day! ( My work is always professional. I have all the license in order to activate Windows Plus Microsoft office. If you go to someone else for windows installation plus for office they guys don't even tell you about the license. They just give you a trial version. And later on after one month you will start getting the error. Called windows in not genuine. Activate your office. So I really really hate this. If you are paying someone for the service it's his responsibility to explain you everything and to be very honest with you. It's ok if you pay one time little more. But you don't need any interruption in your future. That is my point I personally first prefer my customer 100% satisfaction after that money. )","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:09:09-0700","subCategory":{"category":"computer services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/cps/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
