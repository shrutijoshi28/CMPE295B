{"id":"4514703655","adHeader":"Stressed and fragmented by modern life? Meditation training can help.","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lss/4514703655.html","adDetails":"Modern life can be very stressful, we all know this is true to some degree, but we put off doing anything about it until the body or mind reaches a breaking point. We run around so quickly from place to place, from this meeting to that event, and then there are the hundred other things we must juggle to keep our household and family afloat. Sometimes it seems like there is no rest from this daily grind or treadmill, and that we have no choice but to add more and better things to keep up. I offer myself as an inexpensive resource to help you live with the stress, to deal with it directly, by finding a quiet place inside yourself that will always be with you. I do this by giving you some space to breathe, in the form of tailor-made meditation training sessions. Meditation can be a key to returning your mind to some sense of peace and balance, even amid all this background chaos. - What I offer: 1-hour, personal, 1-on-1 Meditation training sessions, at your home or a public location of your choice, at $20 per hour (although I accept donations, I want to keep the price as low as I can possibly manage, as I feel this is something everyone should have access to). Each session is uniquely tailored to you, to what you are dealing with, and to your chosen environment. Most training sessions will involve roughly half instruction, half practice, meaning we will discuss what your needs are in meditation, and what approach would be best for you, then we will actually practice together in a guided method, for the other half. This time allotment includes a buffer of natural ease on either side; which is to say that if you are late to the session, or if you need to leave early, there is no problem either way, and you can take the calm gained in the meditation with you as a result :) - About me: Although I am a Buddhist practitioner with over 9 solid years of deep training in Dzogchen, Tonglen, Samatha/Shamata, Vipassanā, Śūnyatā, and many other forms, I am simply a lay-person, and not a master, not a yogi, not enlightened, and certainly not dogmatic. Additionally, no true practitioner needs to name-drop, so I won't go into my list of masters (unless you ask - I am as open a book as possible). - Difficulty level: Beginner to Advanced; there is no struggle in this training and meditation. We simply go at your level, and your pace, without pretense or arrogance, because even the highest-realized practitioners are still learning, and no one is enlightened. To put your mind a little bit at ease, I am not some crazy person who will bring a host of rituals and strange smells into your home or chosen place of practice, I am a normal-looking fellow who will not show up in robes or something, but jeans and a t-shirt. I truly want your training in meditation to be as authentic and comfortable as possible. It is real-world practice that I will be sharing with you, and so it is best to be exactly who you are, in the world you live in. This way it is much easier to take the practice with you when we are done, instead of leaving it behind. If this sounds like something you are interested in, simply reply with a little bit about why you want to learn to meditate, what times of the week or weekend work best for you, and we will go from there. Thank you for reading, and even if you do not wish to learn from me, I hope you find peace and happiness along your path.","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:52:17-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.785600","longitude":"-122.435800","info":""}}
