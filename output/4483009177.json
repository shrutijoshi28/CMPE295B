My LinkedIn ( Derek Lockyer ): http://www.linkedin.com/pub/derek-lockyer/7/391/3b8/ Last Crowd Sourcing Project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EAi5Hxoovo I am looking to work with and network with Business Owners, Marketing Teams, Independent Producers, Comcast Spotlight Associate Representatives / Executives, and anybody else who wants video remotely edited (and or shot). We use HD cameras with a variety of lenses, (portable) studio lights, microphones, and other filming equipment. I use Dropbox and Skype for file larger transfer. Any new clients that need video content, visit my useful site: http://www.lockyervideoproductions.com I film and edit myself, and bring fellow professionals into the mix depending on the scope of the project. Looking forward to hearing from you!
