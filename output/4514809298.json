Please contact me if you are looking for affordable piano lessons. I am a young but experienced jazz piano player with a classical background who plays live three nights a week. I am experienced at teaching students of all ages and skill levels. For the last ten months I have played jazz in a piano-bass duo three nights a week at a restaurant in the east bay, so I have good experience performing and making a living from my music. I used to play classical piano in recitals and competitions and I still study classical music, and I have played for big bands, recording sessions, done scoring for short films etc. Please contact me if you have any questions. I love to teach students who are eager to learn. Im looking for students who can meet once a week and have access to a piano or keyboard with which they can practice every day. Students would be expected to get a notebook of manuscript paper and a metronome. I usually charge $40/hour. I look forward to hearing from you, Greg show contact info","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:22:39-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.760859","longitude":"-122.495778","info":""}}
