On older systems as plants grow up they either spray over existing plants and plant canopy inhibits water from entering root zone. Even worse the sprinkler head is blocked by plant and one plant next to head gets all the water and the rest of the plants don't get much water until you flood the area. With mini sprayers you can spray at the root zone a one foot 1/2 pattern that will not be affected by wind or evaporation. They have high and low volume heads so you can use one line to cover full sun and full full shade. We have 35+ years of designing and building custom landscapes for our customers.
