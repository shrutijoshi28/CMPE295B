Baby Sensory is brand new to the United States and Baby Sensory California is being launched right here in Cupertino, CA as the ONLY site in all of California and one of just a few in all of the US currently. The Baby Sensory program has been designed specifically for babies from birth. The Baby Development activities stimulate the senses and help your baby develop. We are confident that these baby activities will delight and surprise you and your baby. We use a combination of original and traditional songs and rhymes to develop early communication skills. You will always remember the moment your baby first uses the signs of our Say Hello song which is played at the beginning of each Baby Sensory class. The various baby activities aim to build up a vocabulary of sensory experiences (e.g. visual, auditory and tactile), to enhance physical contact (massage, reflexology, touching, cuddling and rocking) between you and your baby and to promote the development of speech through the use of sign language, music, song and puppets. \"Baby Sensory is a unique learning and developmental program that provides a wealth of sensory experiences for babies from birth to 13 months of age. All activities are accompanied by developmental theory and useful information about how babies learn and develop at different ages and stages. This helps parents understand what to expect from their babies, how best to facilitate their play and how to lead their learning forward.\" - Dr. Lin Day, Creator and Founder of Baby Sensory Baby Sensory California (located in the Oaks shopping center next to the Blue Light Cinemas) 21269 Stevens Creek Blvd., Suite 618 Cupertino, CA show contact info www.babysensorycalifornia.com","subCategory":{"category":"small biz ads","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/biz/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.322842","longitude":"-122.050307","info":"21269 Stevens Creek Blvd. "}}
