We pedal!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/trv/4501168480.html","adDetails":"If you are visiting San Francisco and would like to tour San Francisco's \"Back Yard\" \"off the beaten path\" by mountain bike, or hike then call me. $50.00 per person. You should be reasonably fit as these rides/hikes are meant to be challenging. I have lived in the City on and off for more than 20 years. I can customize you tour to meet any needs. Strictly sight seeing? Okay! Strictly Fitness? Okay! Strictly Dirt? Okay! Strictly Street? Okay! More hills? Okay! Less hills? Maybe A little of everything? Absolutely! Anybody can drive or walk down Lombard St. We ride! I will take you to places in the City that other tour companies can't bring you either because they don't have the means to take you there or they don't know the places exist. Want to get out of the City and ride the Headlands. Repak (the birth of mountain biking) - No Prob! There is not another tour company that can customize a tour the way I can. By far the best and most fulfilling way to see San Francisco. This is one tour where you won't go home feeling guilty because you gained weight. Please ask about our customized tours, individual and large group rates. https://www.facebook.com/pages/San-Francisco-Backyard-Mountain-Bike-Tours/288952017807241","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:26:48-0700","subCategory":{"category":"travel/vacation services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/trv/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.767594","longitude":"-122.481766","info":""}}
