I'll walk your animal for an hour and even break a sweat because I like to, and so do they. so if your dog is 6 months to 6 years old, that's a range I can comfortably embrace as a starting point for a loving relationship. thank your lucky stars you have a ball of fire that may need some tempering. that's where I come in ... I'm a graduate of Doctec & can do doggie CPR. I learn so much working with dogs, hey \"they make great pets\". I'm looking for another dog to work with. I'd love to work with the followings breeds ... vishla, boxers, Boston terrier, Australian shepherds, Labs and a German shepherd would be nice ... any movers and shakers like this are right up my alley. these breeds need consistent & vigorous walking daily to maintain their edge/happiness. do you want them in a ranch hand loop? don't want em hanging with some silly hipster wanna bee with 6 dogs in each hand going through the motions? call me, nothing but the dog in me knows this better than your dog. seriously, 1 on 1, lets roll em out in: Laurel Village, Presidio Heights, Lone Mountain, Upper Fillmore, Inner Sunset, Upper Haight, Cole Valley. this is near my base and very much along my daily route. I'd walk between noon and 3pm, there's wiggle room on the times. my fee is $40 per walk, and we are hitting the trails, beating the pavement (not the band silly) and throwing it on down ... we are marching, we are getting out, life is good !!! please call frankie at show contact info","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:08:17-0700","subCategory":{"category":"pet services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pas/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.778994","longitude":"-122.466288","info":"anza at 8th "}}
