{"id":"4509934658","adHeader":"Sonoma Friendly Movers- The practical help you need for a relaxed move","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/lbs/4509934658.html","adDetails":"Found yourself in need of a few extra hands moving? Make sure when you call a company to talk to someone that it will be that person who will be coming to actually help you come move, and not some kid that they hired off the street last week a 13/hr so they can keep the profits while you get stuck with the one who hardly knows what's going on. Whether you need help today, later this week, or even next month, allow our dedicated team of experienced movers collect, carry, sort, and move your belongings for you--however fragile and important they are--wherever it is you or your loved ones currently need them to go. This is easily one of the most stressful days of your life; let the change of atmosphere be enough. You simply relax, point to where everything needs to be placed in the end, and let us do the heavy moving. We do all types of moves, and we will help you make it work. We usually have a minimum of two hours and a maximum of 12 - 14 hours in one day, but all calls will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Anything longer than 14 hours will be split into two days' of work. We will provide you with a printed estimate at your request to be signed by both parties involved. Contact Ren√© or Michael by text, email, or, preferably, a phone call with any of your inquiries, for quotes, or to schedule a move (all attempts to contact us should be answered within 20-30 minutes, but a phone call is usually immediate). Rates (estimates--dependent on variables: weight of items, stairs, duration, distance, etc.): 1 man: $20-30/hour 2 men: $40-55/hour 3 men: $60-75/hour 4 men: $80-100/hour Please call with information for a better estimate. Simple moves (Boxes, beds, dressers, televisions, washer/dryers, tables) will be done at the lower end of the rates. Complicated moves (carrying 500lb gun safes, moving furniture up/down stairs) tend toward higher rates. We appreciate what is important to you here at Sonoma Friendly Movers and we hope to hear from you.","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:54:26-0700","subCategory":{"category":"labor & moving","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lbs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"38.392666","longitude":"-122.713680","info":"Santa Rosa Ave "}}
