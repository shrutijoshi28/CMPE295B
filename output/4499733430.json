Has your child been asking you for drum lessons? Now's your chance to learn from an experienced and patient teacher. I'm now accepting new students for beginning drums. I have flexibility in scheduling, and the normal schedule would be four 30-minute lessons per month...one per week at a monthly rate of $125.00. I teach at a local music store in Santa Clara. You will learn to play the drums....while having a great time! I will set the class structure based on what you want to learn and/or achieve. If you just want to learn how to \"JAM\".....and have a great time with your friends or, if you want to learn the traditional, and correct way to play...sticking, reading, rudiments, etc...I offer that as well. I have been playing drums for over 30 years and have been taught by some of the best teachers in the area. I have a lot of experience in working bands, but have decided to focus solely on teaching. If interested in learning how to play the greatest instrument ever.....send an email with your contact info and what days and times you're looking to schedule. I will respond within the day to set a schedule that works best for you! I currently teach at a local music store on Friday's, Saturday's and Sunday's, and at my home studio Monday through Thursday. Thank you!
