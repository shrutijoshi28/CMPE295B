Or speak more fluently German? Is this philosophy or theological text just \"jibberish\" to you,, and even after re-reading seems not to make any sense? I give private one-one customized lessons for adults and children who want to refresh their German, or want to learn it completely new. I will coach you through the process to learn German even when you have no prior knowledge, as it is not easy to learn a new language! Can also translate some texts, give lessons in private or group settings. Am a native speaking German, have an extensive background working as educator and teacher, BA and MA (philosophy and religion) USA, teach German, can develop or follow lesson plans, work within a diverse group setting. My price is on a sliding scale, have excellent references. Please email me at germanwords at yahoo dot com for more information or any question you might have! Thank you (Vielen Dank).","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:37:04-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.764100","longitude":"-122.163300","info":""}}
