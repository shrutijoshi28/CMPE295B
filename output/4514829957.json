BONUS: I can teach you to do the same moves to slow jazz or to slow music in a nightclub. ALREADY KNOW SWING? Come brush up on your moves, learn some new ones! SPRING, SUMMER WEDDING? Let's choreograph a fab wedding dance for you both, or a short performance piece for the whole wedding party! Private lessons are only $30/hr. Come with a partner or alone. Beautiful Marina Bay area. Please visit my website: http://www.gotta-swing.com My philosophy is that everyone can learn to dance because there was a time when we were little when moving our body in time to music was the most natural thing in the world...then we got embarassed or self-conscious because of other people...but you can access that fun and natural place again! I specialize in teaching beginners, leaders and people who think they can't dance. So you will have to trust me on this but IF YOU CAN WALK, I CAN TEACH YOU TO DANCE! :-) To book a lesson or for more information, call me at show contact info. Lexie \"I wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying my lessons and how special and important it is that you are teaching me. I am starting to feel the basic steps and hear the music in my head as I go through the day. You are showing me a part of life that I didn't know about. I am really feeling much happier and am so glad I found you. Thank you!\" Michael Haller, Richmond \"Lexie is a great teacher. She is very knowledgeable about everything swing, from its history to the moves she teaches her students. I would recommend her to anyone who wants to learn how to dance.\" Dave, San Lorenzo \"Alexis is a very attentive teacher. Most of all she makes the class fun.\" Liona Rowan \"My wife and I had a great time learning East Coast Swing with Alexis. We came away with new moves each week that we felt confident using on the dance floor. I highly recommend her to any aspiring dancer.\" Clinton Gilbert","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:00:18-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
