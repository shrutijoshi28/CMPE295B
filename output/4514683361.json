Are you planning a celebration? Inviting guest to your home, business or local park? Spend time celebrating/networking with your guest rather than being stuck in front of the hot bbq grill cooking for everyone! With over 12 years of experience bbqing for large events, I can assist you with your graduation, baby shower, birthday, anniversary, or just a good old back yard bbq. Whether you're planning a party for 10 to 250 I can assist you in creating a great event. I have cooked it all...from your traditional hotdogs and burgers to ribs, chicken, lamb, tri-tip, steaks, carne asada, Korean style short ribs, oysters, shrimp, veggies and corndogs (yes you can bbq a corn dog)! I have been hired by many Indian families and have cooked Tandori and Halal meats. Rest assured that all vegetarian options are cooked on a separate part of the grill and separate bbq tools are used. Here is how it work. You purchase the meat and veggies (from Costco) and I grill them to order in large quantities or in batches as your guest arrives! References from fellow Craigslist users just like you who have hired me are available!!! Free travel within the Tri-Valley area. Here's a list of things that set me apart from the other bbq services: -Customer service is my HIGHEST priority. I have received over 40 hours of customer service training (I think Im just as good as Nordstroms!) -I am organized and will return your phone calls/email promptly -I am first aid and cpr certified through the American Red Cross -I have been finger printed and have had my back ground check through the Department of Justice (I work with kids for my day job) -I will arrive to your celebration on time (if not even 15 minutes early) -I will be dressed professionally -Professional and a college graduate -I love to BBQ! Enjoy YOUR party and let me grill for you! ****If you are throwing welcome home/going away party for a member of the military you will receive $10 off per hour***** This is me purchasing meat before a big bbq!","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:53:28-0700","subCategory":{"category":"event services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/evs/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
