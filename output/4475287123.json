I work out of my home and charge a flat fee of 50 dollars to fix your computer, and in 90% of cases I'll have it fixed and ready to be picked up by the next day. In many cases I'll even have it ready on the same day. - Virus and Spyware removal - Boot-up errors - Windows crashes/errors - Systems installation (Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7,8) - Antivirus installation - Hardware installs (hard drives, DVD drives, RAM, graphic card etc...) - Setting up wireless networks - Network installation/Router issues - Anything else related to computers.
