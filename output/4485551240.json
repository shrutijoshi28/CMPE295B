{"id":"4485551240","adHeader":"Guitar Lessons: All Styles... Total Beginners Encouraged!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4485551240.html","adDetails":"I have played for over 25 years, been a gigging musician since my teens, and am a full time guitar teacher and working/touring musician. No matter what style(s) you're into, we can find some songs by your favorite artists and get you playing them. (even if you've never picked up the guitar before!) I have a good track record with beginner/intermediate level players, getting them on the right trajectory, improving efficiently and taking an interest in practicing. I've also worked w/ countless intermediate-advanced players, filling in the blanks in their skill set... self-taught players, etc. Playing styles like PUNK, ALT., HIP-HOP, INDIE, BLUES, CLASSIC or MODERN ROCK, etc. are pretty easy when you get down to it. Learn one song, and you'll realize you can already play 20 others. It's all about having a good, patient teacher who makes sure you make the right choices as far as what to work on. Now that doesn't mean I'm going to assign you a lesson plan. We'll only PLAY TUNES BY YOUR FAVORITE BANDS/artists, if that's what you're into. Bring in ANY CD, and I'll teach you from it on the spot. We can get as far into music theory as you want or just work on playing. Lessons in Downtown Berkeley North side, close to North Berkeley Bart and freeways. Always street parking available! Student and senior discounts. 10$ OFF YOUR 1ST LESSON, if you print this ad and bring it. Thanks for your time! I hope to hear from you soon. The Blueschool Berkeley, CA (plz email for more info and/or to set up a phone consultation)","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:17:51-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
