Finally Start Getting Better!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4483527252.html","adDetails":"Learning an instrument is a long, complex process. It's been my experience as a teacher (12 years full-time, adult and teen specialist) that many players stagnate not due to a lack of motivation, desire/passion to learn, or adequate practice time... but due to more habitual and emotional \"roadblocks.\" One of the hardest things about learning an instrument is realizing that you not only have to keep working on new material/concepts but also must completely \"re-learn\" or @ least re-think some things you do all the time to keep getting better. Whether it's an emotional/psychological response, unconscious habit, or an actual gap or flaw in your playing skill set... All of this needs to be addressed for you to make adequate progress... For example: When a beginner student learns \"the other way\" to play Gmaj in 1st pos (the one that is like a C chord shape), they often get discouraged because they \"thought they had that G thing taken care of.\" I encourage them to think of it as a brand new chord called \"X.\" We learn new chords all the time including more difficult shapes than \"other G.\" We can work on scales, songs, AND address these common mental and emotional/psychological \"road blocks\" I see my students struggling with. It's my opinion that this type of \"guitar psychology\" is straight up required for many guitarists to get past \"playing the stuff they always play\" and start having big breakthroughs. I hear a lot of \"other teacher\" horror stories involving them having a fixed set of things they teach precisely so they don't have to address each student's individual needs. (and every student is so different!!!) It seems like they're \"afraid\" to run out of teaching material, because they only have the ability to help their students within their own teaching comfort zone. We will address \"chops,\" technique and theory/fretboard vision and also take a closer look at your own psychological/emotional processes. You might be surprised how fast you you get better.... I've seen it again and again w/ students of all ages and genre interests. **It can be things as simple as what order to work on things in when memorizing a new concept in practice... IE adding an extra step where you just repeat \"new riff x\" stopping after each time and \"resetting\" rather than moving on to the next section too soon. It can be as simple as recognizing that it's your (one's) tendency to \"trip out\"/become frustrated/get emotional when faced with a difficult guitar task. It's a fight/flight response thing, basic human nature... Many people tend to give up right when they're about to \"get it.\" When learning a difficult concept, the brain says \"ok, I get this section/riff/concept generally and will come back to it and finish\" when just playing it 2-4 more times might be all it took to nail it once and for all. Here's a good example... People turn learning note names into a complex and time consuming task, when it's really so much easier. IE \"having trouble\" memorizing that the 6th string, 7th fret is B and 5th string 7th fret is E. People turn knowing where the 10th fret is into a deductive reasoning problem. (\"I'll think about the 12 fret and count back.\") That is a really simple task, as is assigning two \"names\" to 2 \"dots.\" We learned to do that when we were VERY young. Due to the visual nature of playing guitar in a modern context, people can subconsciously get stuck below the 5th fret b/c of things this \"easy\"... or maybe know that the 6th string, 7th fret is B but only if you're thinking about a Bm bar chord or pentatonic scale/\"box.\" These are just a few common examples.... Hopefully I can help you turn the page where others haven't and get you motivated to move past \"the stuff you always play.\" Thanks for your time.
