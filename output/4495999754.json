Then I work with you to fix your specific struggle areas, with ultimate goal of improve your grades. ►Customized explanations to fit your learning style. I explain concepts in multiple ways to figure out your learning style, then I gear all my future explanations to fit your specific learning style. ►Learn how to study smart. I will teach you a study system that allows you to get better grades while studying less. I used the same system to get a 3.93 GPA at UC Berkeley while only studying for 2 hours a day ►Step by step homework assistance. In addition, I'll teach you how to systematically solve problems that seem difficult at first. ►Confidence to do well in chemistry. You'll walk into exams with complete confidence because you understand the material so well. There Are Other Tutors Out There. Why Should You Hire Me? What separates me from other chem tutors is that I don't focus solely on comprehension of the class material. Acing the class involves more than just understanding the material. Sure comprehension is important, but if you can't apply the material, then your grade will suffer. If you can't deconstruct a problem, and figure out which concept to use, your grade will plummet. If you can't select the right answer among answers that all sound somewhat correct, your grade will drop. Etc. I help you improve on all these areas so that when the exam comes around, you'll be ready to rock it. Secondly, unlike other tutors who teach every subject imaginable, I ONLY tutor chemistry. What this means for you is that I can explain concepts in multiple ways until you \"get it\". With over 400 hours of chemistry tutoring under my belt, you can be confident that I will be able to answer any question you ask. I've helped students with problems ranging from those who were so far behind they didn't know where to start to those who just couldn't make the jump for a B to an A. And I can help you reach your goal. Lastly, I won't just teach you chemistry. I will also teach you a study system that maximizes your efficiency so you finish your homework faster. Using this system, you'll be able study less while still get good grades. Personally I used this study system at UC Berkeley and it allowed me to get a 3.93 GPA while only studying for two hours a day. This system is extremely easy to implement and it will help you get higher grades in high school and in college. Most tutors don't even teach you basic study skills. Pricing ► $45 / hr In my last job, I tutored chemistry though a company that charged students $105 / hour. I'm offering the same level of service. Less than half the cost. Anna K:\"He is able to explain things in a well thought out, clear and concise manner. Michael doesn't' just take you through the step-by-step process for solutions and give you the answer. He guides you though the process in a way that one must think independently in order to solve the problems or answer the questions. This way of teaching has really strengthened my studies and analytical way of looking at my work.\" Scottie W:\"I distinctly remember being quite overwhelmed and confused during the first few weeks of the course, but Michael was able to clearly explain and differentiate the topics and equations discussed in class.\" What To Do Next If you want to do better in chemistry and remove the stress associated with failing a class, then contact Michael by clicking reply above.
