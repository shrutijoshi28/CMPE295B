I'm a semiretired semihippy who's been walking and housesitting dogs in the Cole Valley/Ashbury Heights area since 2002. I prefer to walk dogs offleash at Buena Vista park or Mount Sutro in groups of three or four but due to attrition i'm down to one or two so i'm actively seeking more dogs. i'm only interested in medium or large size dogs who behave well with other dogs and come when they're called. On the walks I do everything I can to protect the dogs from themselves and other dogs, and to increase their happiness and obedience. $15. when housesitting I walk them four times a day and pet and play with them a lot. $50 a day in my area, more elsewhere. I have very good references. 681 4624.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:16:59-0700","subCategory":{"category":"pet services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pas/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.762980","longitude":"-122.446918","info":""}}
