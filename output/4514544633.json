However, we always respect and comply with the school administrations guidelines. Most disc-jockeys utilize a sound system designed to be used at small to medium sized events. These sound systems usually include two medium sized speakers and a mid-sized amplifier. While this type of sound system is suitable for weddings and other private parties, they are not suitable when used in gymnasiums or other large rooms with 200 -- 600 students. There are two factors that make a larger sound system necessary at most school dances: The size of a room used for a school dance is three or four times larger than the average banquet hall. In addition, the height of the ceiling absorbs sound quickly. The average number of students attending a school dance is 250 people. The sheer quantity of people absorb sound. This is the most important factor!! Gym or Cafeteria ? When a regular DJ sound system is used at a school dance inside a gymnasium or other large room or multi purpose room, the disc-jockey quickly realises that he or she cannot get enough sound out of the system to fill the room. This usually results in the DJ pushing the small sound system to its maximum limits. When this happens, you usually get an \"ear-piercing\" amount of treble coming out of the speakers in an effort to play \"louder\". \" The Big Sound System \" When a large state-of-the-art sound system is used for a school dance, you get a totally different sound.Instead of an ear-piercing loud noise, you get a deep, rich, crystal-clear sound that is pleasing to the ear. It is hard to believe but we actually get fewer loud volume complaints with our large sound system than the smaller one. The reason is because we let the bass fill the gym, not the ear-piercing treble. In contrast to a regular DJ sound system, our large deluxe sound system utilizes four large speakers, and an amplifier that has four times the power of our regular one. The end result difference between our regular sound system and our deluxe is comparable to a boom box and a full sized stereo system. The choice is yours. Choose the sound system and service that you feel will best serve your needs. Please call us if you have any questions. Bay Area Music note: (We only play All Clean Music radio edit) We have the music you want all clean versions. We keep up with all the latest music, including Rap, Dance, Alternative rock Michael Jackson, and Top 40. In an effort to ensure that we have what you want, we encourage you to submit a list of requests prior to the event. No other DJ company can match our level of service to provide the students with the music they want to dance to! Disc-Jockey interaction The amount of interaction we provide depends greatly on the school. Typically, for elementary and middle schools, we are very outgoing and interactive by providing games and contests for the students. We highly recommend that the school provide ten to fifteen door prizes for this approach, as it is the students incentive to participate in the games and contests we can supply some of the prizes. In contrast, at most high school events, we are there to provide our awesome sound and lighting system, and play the music the students want to dance to! In most cases, high school students are not interested in games and contests, but we are happy to provide this approach upon request.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:02:30-0700","subCategory":{"category":"event services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/evs/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
