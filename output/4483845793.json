She uses many sources to aid learning, and adjusts when asked, or if she sees an area that needs more in-depth work. In other words, she has lesson plans, but isn't tied to them. She finds out what the student needs - school help; travel plans, etc. She is originally from Argentina, and taught with Berlitz, so you get the real thing in terms of background. She teaches primarily in her home, which is set up nicely to ensure no distractions. However, she has been known to meet students in other local places. Patience, patience, patience!!! - I am not the quickest study, and I ask a LOT of questions, and Cristina has never lost patience with me. She listens to the student - she is focused on you for the whole lesson. Bottom Line: We live in an area where there is a lot of Spanish to be experienced, and I would recommend Cristina as your tutor. You won't regret it.\" - Anita M., Concord \"Cristina worked with me over a couple years and really helped me launch my Spanish to higher levels. She was well organized in structuring our meetings to meet my goals for all aspects of Spanish from conversation to grammar and writing. You will be pleased to work with her.\" - Tom Z., Orinda \"Cristina tutored me in Spanish since it had been over 20 years since I last studied the language in college. My current position requires me to be bilingual and within two months time Cristina had me speaking fluently enough in Spanish that my supervisor at work even took notice of how much progress I had made in such a short amount of time. I love the comfort of going to her home for lessons because the atmosphere is so relaxed and non intimidating. She makes herself available if I should need to contact her via email or Skype. I highly recommend Cristina to anyone who is looking to improve their Spanish. Fun,enjoyable, and a great learning experience.\" - Lisa B., Lafayette keywords: ina, espanol, instruction, instructor, course, courses, learn, learning, tutoring, teaching, teacher, trainer, training, orinda, lamorinda, walnut creek, concord, pleasant hill, ACALANES HIGH SCHOOL, BENTLEY HIGH SCHOOL, CAMPOLINDO HIGH SCHOOL, DE LA SALLE HIGH SCHOOL, DIABLO VALLEY COLLEGE, DORRIS-EATON SCHOOL, LAS LOMAS HIGH SCHOOL, MIRAMONTE HIGH SCHOOL, SAN JOAQUIN MIDDLE SCHOOL, STANLEY MIDDLE SCHOOL, WAGNER RANCH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:41:06-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.888267","longitude":"-122.128723","info":"8 West Creek Court "}}
