Highlights include: -Flexible schedule options -Sign up for Part or All of the Summer -Private or group lessons -Excellent prep for fall School Programs *There is no registration fee for the summer lesson program.* Choosing between Group and Private Lessons: When enrolling for piano instruction, parents and students have the option of either group or private lessons. Some students work particularly well in small groups. The group format allows for certain activities that are not available during private lessons, such as musical games and playing together in duets and other combinations. Some students develop their rhythmic skills more quickly in this format because of these opportunities. Parents and teachers have also observed that students in group lessons improve their skills of cooperation and peer interaction, all while having fun as they learn alongside their classmates. If group lessons are not available at a convenient time, then private lessons are always a great way to go. A child can change from group to private lessons at any time. In private lessons, each student can learn at his or her own pace and the teacher can focus completely on that individual student's strengths and weaknesses. Group Piano Classes are for beginning students. All students learn the fundamentals of piano or keyboard playing including technique, sight reading, theory and repertoire. Group Piano classes also give students the opportunity to make music both individually and as part of a group. Group lessons are grouped according to age.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:01:52-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.333177","longitude":"-121.988239","info":""}}
