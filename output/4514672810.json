We've .. ~ cleared dozens of yards, driveways, and road-frontages of all kinds. ~ rescued cars from garages so weed-choked that the doors wouldn't open. ~ reclaimed gardens, pumphouses, and patios from the 'green jungles'. ~ and reunited kids with more missing toys than we can count. The rains have ended, and Sonoma's weeds are drying out fast. So before the weeds grow any higher, let us get rid of them for you! We're a local landscape and yardcare team, with years of experience in high-weed projects, and very good at what we do. We use weed-mowers, cane-cutters, trimmers, and riding-mowers, whichever tools best fit the project. And we can arrange for full-field tractor-mowing using a flail-mower, mowing down an acre+ per hour. We cover the central region of Sonoma county, from Healdsburg all the way south to Petaluma, and from Sebastopol and west county all the way east through the Sonoma valley. Good, reasonable rates, with senior discounts possible. We have lower rates for larger projects, so that when you have lots of work for us to do, we can use a lesser rate. Just ask for details. Call us anytime at 888 7590 or 623 2953.","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:44:04-0700","subCategory":{"category":"farm & garden services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fgs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"38.432178","longitude":"-122.722929","info":""}}
