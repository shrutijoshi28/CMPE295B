{"id":"4483645786","adHeader":"Pro Mechanic For Hire","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/aos/4483645786.html","adDetails":"Welcome. I have been a Professional Mechanic for 14 years and I work in the South Bay Area. I am experienced with American, Foreign, and Luxury cars and I am Mobile. I charge a Low Hourly Rate and I guarantee my labor costs will be half of what any shop or dealership would charge. I have top-quality tools and very steady hands. I can diagnose any problem with your vehicle and have it fixed the same day. I also diagnose check engine lights and do Full Tune Ups. I have commercial accounts with Auto Parts Stores in the area that allow me to get quality parts at low prices, depending on the Make and Model of your vehicle. I am searching for consistent customers who are looking to save money on Auto Repairs and Routine Maintenance. I can also teach you how to do your own repairs while I work on your car. I can fix anything on your car: Ignition Systems, Fuel Systems, Intake Systems, Water Pumps, Timing Belts, Head Gaskets, Oil leaks, Transmissions, You name it, I can fix it. The only thing I don't do is body work or painting. You can email Allen anytime, Day or Night. I will provide you with the best quote possible. Thank Your for Your Time.","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:17:43-0700","subCategory":{"category":"automotive services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/aos/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.318000","longitude":"-122.044900","info":""}}
