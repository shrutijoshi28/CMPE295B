You are the supervising attorney! For people who are not California licensed Attorneys: I am not an attorney and cannot give you legal advice. All law related work will be performed under the personal supervision of a licensed California attorney as required by California law. Any legal advice will be given by my supervising attorney in a conference between you, myself, and the attorney. If you are a non-lawyer, you should only seek legal advice from a licensed California attorney. California does not require paralegals to graduate from ABA certified paralegal programs at this time. There is no charge for my supervising attorney's time at the conference. You will only be charged for my paralegal time. Any paralegal work I do for you will be reviewed by my supervising attorney for legal accuracy at no extra charge to you. You are entering into a contract with my supervising attorney and the supervising attorney sets my rates that you are charged for my paralegal time. I do not contract with non-lawyers or set my own rates. People who are not licensed California attorneys may not perform legal or paralegal services unless they are supervised by and working for, a licensed California attorney. This includes law school graduates and lawyers who are admitted in other states but not in California. Such persons, if unsupervised, are only allowed to perform limited law-related services for non-lawyers, like filling out forms at the direction of the client, filing and serving (not preparing) legal documents, and providing material that has been pre-written by a California licensed attorney. They cannot give legal advice or prepare non-form type legal documents on their own. (There may be exceptions for practice before certain public agencies like the workers compensation.
