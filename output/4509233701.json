{"id":"4509233701","adHeader":"Custom Furniture Refinishing","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/crs/4509233701.html","adDetails":"Hello, Do you have a piece of furniture you would love to \"shabby chic\" but don't have the time, materials, and space to do it yourself? I would love to help. I am an experienced painter and crafter who loves giving worn, old pieces a new personality. Materials: The materials I use are all top of the line. Mostly, I paint with Annie Sloan Chalk paint and waxes but if you prefer the look of latex or milk paint that is always an option. Cost: Cost is determined by the cost of materials and the amount of time placed into each piece. The cost is negotiable and based on the size of the piece and your desired outcome. Transportation: The item(s) can be picked up and delivered for an extra fee. This fee is determined by the distance and the size of the piece. Any items within a 10 mile radius of Concord, CA can be picked up and delivered for a flat rate of $20. If you would prefer to not pay the delivery fee, you can drop the furniture off yourself at a predetermined time. Length of Projects: The length of time each project will take to complete is dependent on the size of the furniture and the exact specifications from you, the owner. A rough estimate would be anywhere between 4-10 days. This allows time for each coat of paint to dry and for the wax to set. The images pictured are examples of my previous refinishing jobs. There is also an image showing all of the available Annie Sloan paint colors you can choose from, but are not limited too. Feel free to contact me with any questions regarding a particular piece or project you would like completed. I would love to do business with you!
