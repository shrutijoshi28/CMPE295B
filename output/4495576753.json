I represent clients all over the Bay Area, and make regular appearances in the courts of Santa Clara County and San Mateo County. I believe that everyone deserves excellent legal counsel - no matter how \"small\" your case or how thin your wallet, you deserve a lawyer whose sole job is looking out for your interests. That is why, in most cases, I offer flat fees - so that you know, up front, how much your case is going to cost. http://www.saffordlegal.com Before I moved to the Bay Area, I worked for criminal defense firms in Colorado and Ohio. We handled every type of misdemeanor and felony case, from the smallest infraction to serious felonies such as drug trafficking, sex offenses, armed robbery, and violent crime. I have experience working with witness testimony, scientific/forensic evidence, and the murky depths of criminal law. Even if you haven't been charged with a crime, if you have had contact with the police, or believe you are being investigated, it is never too early to get some help. Contact me right away for a free consultation. Please Note: This is an advertisement for attorney services.
