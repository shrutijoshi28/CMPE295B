The main concern is that if you were not the one who has applied the existing wallpaper finishes, you really have no idea how the product was originally applied. Among the things to consider include the kind of adhesive used, if the surfaces were sized or primed, and so on. Not knowing all of these makes it very hard to evaluate how difficult or easy it is to strip the wallpaper off as well as the level of damage the job will do to the substrate, especially with drywall.
