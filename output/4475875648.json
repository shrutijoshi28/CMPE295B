And may you find good fortune at your new location! Hi Everybody, just want you to know that Antonio and his assistant did a fantastic job loading our 17 foot U-Haul truck in San Francisco, We went all the way to Palm Springs. Only a few things moved in the truck and when we moved in to our new home absolutely nothing was broken. We are extremely pleased with Antonio's services in every way. He was excellent to communicate, he was on time, he was cheerful and positive and he made the stressful experience of moving (almost) a pleasure. We've had bad movers in the past, so we know what thats like -- so we are very happy to say: \"Thank you, Antonio!\" peace and success to everybody, David and Linda Ramsdale (happily in Palm Springs, CA :))","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:54:40-0700","subCategory":{"category":"labor & moving","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lbs/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
