Good live music can make it even more of a day to remember. Great music provides an atmospheric backdrop for your guests as they gather for the ceremony and is the perfect accompaniment for any wedding breakfast. Alternatively, for an evening reception, beautiful piano music is the antidote to noisy discos. I am a professional wedding pianist with many years of experience in piano performances. I can perform for your ceremony anywhere in the bay area.
