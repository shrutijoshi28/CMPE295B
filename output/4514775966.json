I am posting this ad for my father, who is looking for a house to sit permanently. He is a tall, 50something year old New Zealand native with a great accent.Although he's a New Zealand native, he has been living in San Mateo County for the past 25 years, and would like to find a new residence in the same area. If you or your family are looking for someone to occupy a small portion, or in law unit, in your home because you are often out of town, he is the man for you. He can fulfill the following duties: -Collect your mail and newspapers so it seems like someone is always home to outsiders -Feed, walk and take care of your pets (if desired) -Do handy work around your home (he has been a contractor since the age of 16) -Take care of your plants, mow lawns, etc. If my dad sounds like someone you would like to watch your home while you're away, please respond to the email listed above with a little about yourself :) Thanks for your time","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:33:09-0700","subCategory":{"category":"household services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/hss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.567100","longitude":"-122.367600","info":""}}
