Does your computer also have a whole host of slow, annoying trial programs that you aren't interested in? I can get rid of Windows 8, install a fresh copy of Windows 7, along with security updates, MS office, antivirus software, etc. I can come to your location or meet you at a local coffee shop with your laptop. Have a netbook with no optical drive? Not a problem. The entire process should take about an hour and will only set you back $50.
