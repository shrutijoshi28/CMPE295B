About me: My name is Shari (pronounced like Sherry with an 'e'). I am a 49 year-old mature, responsible, trustworthy, reliable and compassionate woman. I have had a love of animals my entire life. I had a beloved golden retriever for 10 years and have had a sheltie for 6 years. I have also had rabbits. I have a flexible schedule and can provide daily visits ($20/hour) while you are at work or traveling in addition to overnight stays ($80/night). My clients allow me to bring my sweet, 14 year-old sheltie with me when I stay overnight. Rates and services are flexible depending on your particular situation and the needs of your animal(s). Daily status updates can be provided via email or text. I apologize but I cannot board animals in my home. Complimentary initial in-home consultation is included for all new customers. Areas that I service are: Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon, Danville, Alamo and Blackhawk. Bonded (#100179349) and licensed. Please contact me at show contact info if you are interested in my services. This is the best way to contact me as email tends to end up in my Spam folder. You can also visit my website at: http://www.sharisconciergeservices.com. Testimonials from my satisfied clients are listed there. Thank you for your interest!","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:35:37-0700","subCategory":{"category":"pet services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pas/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.756200","longitude":"-121.952200","info":""}}
