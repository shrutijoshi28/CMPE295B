{"id":"4511118249","adHeader":"Free GMAT Tutoring Meetup, 99th %ile Scorer, ($240 value, 600 members)","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lss/4511118249.html","adDetails":"Hello all! The biggest hurdle to scoring highly on the GMAT is establishing and maintaining your study habits, so come and let's work on that together! I am a private tutor who scored in the 99th percentile, and I am offering 90 minutes of free tutoring in my home to groups of 3 or more. I have a large (4'x8') dry erase board which is perfect for groups of 3-6. You can find the meetup page here: www.Meetup.com/Free-Gmat-Prep We will use the Official Guide, so please have a copy when we meet. It is available in paperback and on Kindle: http://www.amazon.com/The-Official-Guide-GMAT-Review/dp/1118109791/ As space is limited and clicking \"yes\" is not a 100% guarantee of your intention to attend, to confirm your spot we will need to speak on the phone the day before. Please email me your phone number and scores (Total, Quantitative, and Verbal). If you do not know your score, you will join the average score (550) group. If you cannot attend this meetup but would like to attend a future one, please notify me. Hope to see you here!","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:12:39-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.785600","longitude":"-122.435800","info":""}}
