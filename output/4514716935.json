My work consists abstract painting, performance,video projection and printmaking and graphic design. I am therefore a cross over artist when it comes to graphic design. Teaching philosophy I believe (and have proven through 5 years fo teaching) that, a student can be motivated to learn to be creative in the arts. I am a motivator, always seeking to make sure that I find my students strengths and weaknesses. Teaching art,whether it be fine art (painting,drawing,printmaking) or Graphic design (Photoshop and Video Production using Adobe Premiere) requires one to understand the students needs and tailor the lesson to meet them while at the same time fulfilling the role of educating them on the fundamentals of the subject. Each student is different and therefore requires special attention-which I provide. In my years of teaching, I have left students motivated,educated and confident about what they can do. In my view, every student is gifted, it is my role as a teacher to identify that gift and help the student fully utilize it. My guarantee Given the chance,I will open up the world of art in a short space of time,the student will be guaranteed to have learnt enough to carry on by themselves in 3-10 lessons. Why? Because I love what I do which is art and I do what I love, which is teaching!Connect with over 30,000 local, in-home tutors at WyzAnt.com!","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:25:33-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.836100","longitude":"-122.263700","info":""}}
