{"id":"4514845817","adHeader":"Is your son or daughter struggling with English in school?","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/lss/4514845817.html","adDetails":"I'm a friendly tutor who works in Millbrae, Burlingame, San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City with 2 college degrees including a master's degree in International Relations. I have 12 years of experience and work hard to make sure my student understands English grammar, speaking, vocabulary, writing and comprehension. I can be reached at show contact info. I work well with English Second Language students. Fortunately, the first lesson is free and this allows you to see how I tutor and allows me to see if your student wants to be tutored. I can tutor you and your student at your home or at the local library. Each lesson is 90 minutes and I charge $35 an hour. I have tutored students as young as 5th grade through high school and students who have attended Stanford and UC Berkeley. Let's talk. The first lesson is free. Please call Tim at show contact info.","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:37:12-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.573500","longitude":"-122.322500","info":""}}
