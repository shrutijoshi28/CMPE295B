I teach at a local music store, and I also teach at my home. Please contact me if interested as I have very flexible hours. Lessons are 4 (30) minutes lessons per month, with the first lesson being one hour. I have been teaching for many years and have now played the drums for over 41 years. I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks!
