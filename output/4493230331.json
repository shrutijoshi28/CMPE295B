{"id":"4493230331","adHeader":"LOCAL DOG WALKER & PET SITTER","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/pas/4493230331.html","adDetails":"I'm offering affordable dog walking, visiting, sitting, & socializing for pups in the East Bay. Typically do neighborhood walks, over-nights, on/off leash, feeding, etc. I've had animals my entire life and have been caring for other folks' animals for about 8 years now--some sick, some healthy, some young, some old. Many dogs need special attention, and I'm happy to adapt to your dog's personal needs on a case-by-case basis. Currently I'm apprenticing as an assistant in the training department at Oakland SPCA and the Berkeley Humane Society. I understand canine body language, behavior, and psychology-- your pups will be in good hands. Check me out on Yelp: http://www.yelp.com/biz/dog-party-oakland Summer is basically here, so let's talk about getting your pups outdoors for some fun! If you have questions or if you're interested in meeting, send me an email. References are available upon request.
