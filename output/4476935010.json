I'll live in your home during the day and overnight for one night to two to three weeks or more. Rates depend on number of animals and length of stay. During the summer I'll water as well. Your dog(s) will be walked at least daily, more if you don't have a yard, and/or taken to the dog park if you wish. Friendly dogs only, please, although I do have some experience with \"difficult\" smaller dogs. Cats boxes will be cleaned daily of course. Fish and other pets OK too. References, bonded and insured in your home, in my car, on a walk or at the dog park. An interview in advance is necessary for both of us. Please email the above address. Tell me the species and breed of your animals, and the dates you will need a sitter. Photos are very welcome. Thank you, I promise to respond quickly! key words: dog sitter, dog sitting, cat sitter, pet sitter, pet nanny, pet sitting, doggie nanny, pet watcher, palo alto, menlo park, Atherton, Portola Valley, Woodside, Los Altos Hills, peninsula, SF Peninsula, south peninsula, south bay area, southern peninsula","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:14:57-0700","subCategory":{"category":"pet services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pas/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
