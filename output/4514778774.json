{"id":"4514778774","adHeader":"Italian Teacher in San Francisco","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/lss/4514778774.html","adDetails":"• Who are you? I'm a native Italian tutor and teacher who believes in a positive, non-judgmental teaching attitude based on having fun while learning. I have more than 10 years experience tutoring and I am currently an Italian teacher at a leading SF Italian school. My Linkedin profile and references are available upon request. • What about your teaching technique? The lessons are based on speaking and listening. This is the most effective learning technique, because you will learn Italian or refine your Italian skills without frustrations, while soaking up grammar and syntax. • What about the classes? My classes are typically one hour long, one-on-one (but you can come with a friend and split the hourly rate!). Classes are conversational and built around your favorite topics. I am well up on literature, cinema, food and wine, art (I'm Italian after all!) and, most importantly, I am able to create personalized lessons according to your favorite subjects. • How does it work? It's easy--you shoot me an email and ask me all the informations you need. I will reply with the requested infos and a short questionnaire. Your answers to the questionnaire will enable me to create your personalized lessons. If you like your learning plan, we will set up a schedule and begin our Italian adventure!","postDate":"2014-06-10T21:36:52-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
