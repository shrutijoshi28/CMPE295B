I've played piano my whole life, and I'm very passionate in piano performances and teaching. My goal is to make the process of learning music fun while effective for every student. I also make sure to expose my students to different musical instruments; I think this is very important specially for children and those students who are still not sure what musical instrument they would like to master. My rate is $70 for 60 minutes. You can have weekly or bi-weekly sessions. Please drop me an email or call me at show contact info if you have any questions. If you leave me your phone number, I will call you as soon as I get a chance. Thanks for your interest.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:06:22-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.352829","longitude":"-121.968327","info":""}}
