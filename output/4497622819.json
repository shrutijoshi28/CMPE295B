Experience the best with a Custom Designed Program working with your strengths and weaknesses to ensure you are prepared and ready for this important exam. Begin this summer for a head start. The SAT AND SSAT are our specialties. We design custom programs for each individual student because we have found after 22 years experience that this is simply the best way to prepare for the test. Because each program is individually catered to meet each student's particular needs, we can focus on those areas that the student needs the most practice and not waste time covering unnecessary areas. In the \"cookie cutter mold\" SAT programs out there, all students are treated the same, thus not paying attention to their unique strengths and weaknesses. Small group Sessions are also available of 2 or 3 students in each group. We can show you exactly what you need to know and how best to go about learning the skills and strategies you need do do your best on these tests. Whether we like it or not, this test is more about how well you know how to take the test rather than knowing the specific material. Most students would significantly improve their score by learning a few simple strategies on how to take this test. There are specific strategies for each section and for each type of problem. Once you know these strategies, the test becomes a lot less intimidating and your score goes up. You really owe it to yourself to learn these strategies. It is simply not smart (or effective) to take the SAT without them. So let's begin preparing now for these upcoming tests. WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT The mainstream SAT companies that spend lots of money on advertising rely on hiring the cheapest tutors while charging top of the line prices. The result is that they do not get the best tutors, and thus not the best results. We have been doing this over 20 years. We know these tests. We know the strategies you need to do well on them. WHO WE ARE We have been practicing in Marin County for over 20 years with a wide range of teaching and tutorial experience. We have helped students of all ages, from first grade to retirees. We have tutored students from all the middle and High Schools in Marin, both public and private and well as schools in San Francisco. We also help adults with the testing they need to advance their careers or change career directions; everything from passing the CBEST test to completing a long forgotten GED. We have helped adults brush up on Spanish before an upcoming trip to Spain and have given them the skills they need to begin talking with a grandchild who was recently adopted from Guatemala.
