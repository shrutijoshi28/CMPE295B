The Color Code International has been answering that question by providing world-class training workshops, keynote speeches, and team building events for over twenty-five years. If you are looking for a speaker, trainer, and/or facilitator for an upcoming event, I am a highly qualified professional who will absolutely deliver the results you are looking to achieve - every time! My presentations are centered in the Color Code Personality System developed by Taylor Hartman, PhD. The Color Code Personality Assessment is the most accurate, comprehensive, and easy to use personality test available. Unlike other personality tests, The Color Code not only identifies WHAT you do but WHY you do it, allowing you to gain much deeper and more useful insights into what makes you and those around you tick. If you'd like to improve a relationship with anyone in your life, gain an advantage at the office, or just get to know yourself a little better, I invite you to give me a call or email me, today! Because I deal with people and personalities, my topics can be customized to fit many different Soft-Skills or EQ related topics. Some of these topics include: Team Building Interpersonal Relationship Skills Communication Strategies Sales Effectiveness Leadership/Management Customer Service Personal & Professional Development Dating/Couples/Parenting Etc., (many other topics can be customized upon request) I can provide speaking services to large conferences in need of a Keynote Speaker and/or Break-Out Session Facilitator. I also cater to smaller groups who may be looking for a speaker to kick off a company meeting in a fresh, new way. My keynote speeches are usually delivered from the stage or a podium and typically run about one-hour in length, but can be expanded or contracted depending on your group's needs. I incorporate the use of fresh visuals, humor, and illustrative movie clips (time-permitting). Much of the work that I perform is in the facilitation of workshops and team building events for private clients. Many of these presentations take place in relatively small groups. I want you to see me as a valued business consultant not just another trainer/speaker, therefore leading up to the actual event, I spend time to coordinate specific objectives/desired outcomes with the team leader(s) to ensure that each presentation exactly fits the client's needs. I also invite participants to take our Color Code Personality Assessment prior to the session. I use visuals during the workshop such as name tags with a Color Coded pie chart display and/or colored wristbands, etc., so that participants can quickly apply what they are learning to help improve specific relationships within the group. I also prepare unique follow up trainings and consultations, conference calls, etc. Team workshops typically are structured around a half- to full-day schedule, though the time frame may be shortened if necessary. These presentations are highly engaging as I incorporate the use of visuals, humor, appropriate movie clips, and even hands-on activities and competitions to ensure that we maintain the group's peak level of interest at all times. While my Keynote Speaking and Team Building workshops are experienced by groups, I do offer public events for individuals. These typically take place online to allow people from all parts of the world to participate. Some of my online workshops are presented as half-day programs and individual participants are invited to join in via a live webinar. Participants receive materials prior to the online workshops which include items such as Workbooks, Code Cards, their Personality Assessment, and an Audio CD. Those materials are used during the course of the presentation. Other workshops may take place over the span of several weeks in 60-90 minute sessions with homework assignments in between. If you are interested in being notified of upcoming online workshops for individuals, please call or email me to make arrangements for you to attend. When calling or emailing me please provide the following information so that I can serve you better: Contact person's name, phone number, and email, company or organization's name and which service(s) you are interested in, such as Keynote Speaker, Training For Your Team, Online Workshop, Complementary \"Brown Bag\" Special lunchtime keynote speaker, or Individual Relationship Coaching.
