{"id":"4514594464","adHeader":"BEWARE!!! ::TIM'S GARDENING SERVICE (novato)","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/fgs/4514594464.html","adDetails":"This guy could not be more of a disaster. He worked for me for 1.5 days. It was the most INSANE experience of my lifetime. 1. I sent him to Sloats, 2 miles away, to buy pink fuchsias and pink impatiens. He charges by the hour, so, of course, he goes to Home Depot in San Rafael instead. Cha-ching. THEN, he returns with purple fuschias and white impatiens. WTF?? 2. I tell him not to buy mulch until I buy shrubs. He shows up the next day with mulch that I'm supposed to pay for. 3. He was supposed to show up on Day 2 with an irrigation clock, but he could not afford the $100.00, so he bought the mulch instead. It later occurred to me that he was hoping to take 4 hours to put down 7 bags of mulch to earn the $100.00 to go get the clock in the afternoon. I know - right? 4. There's nowhere to put the unwanted mulch, so I tell him to store it in the bags in an empty planter box. Are you sitting down? He takes the existing mulch OUT of a bed that I told him expressly to not touch, and he puts the new mulch in the bed to replace the perfectly good old mulch that I put in 3 weeks ago. 5. An hour later, Tim wants to chat over coffee and cookies. I am on a business conference call, and refuse. When I didn't fall for that one, he tried to get me to go to San Rafael to pay for the irrigation clock. Cha-ching again. I refused, and wrote out a check directly to the irrigation store and sent Tim Leon on his way without me. Can ya' believe this loser? 6. It gets worse. I gave him a check made out to a retail store in San Rafael to buy the irrigation clock. The check was made out TO THE STORE. You guessed it - Tim Leon actually deposited the check into his personal checking account and took off. NO SHIT. The check was for $115.00, and he is now banned from the store as a result. So, I have the wrong flowers in my yard, mulch that I don't need, no irrigation clock and a totally pissed off bank, which has to now hunt this guy down and prosecute him for fraud. He must not be using his real name, because nobody by that name is listed in Marin or Sonoma. If it wasn't for the $500.00 that Tim Leon scammed from me, I might be laughing my ass off. I would recommend that you put a bullet through your brain before you think of calling this guy. It would be just as effective and a lot less painful.","postDate":"2014-06-10T18:40:19-0700","subCategory":{"category":"farm & garden services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fgs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.381100","longitude":"-122.334800","info":""}}
