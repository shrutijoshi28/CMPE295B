{"id":"4514821164","adHeader":"DUI-Award Winning Former D.A. with 25+ Years Exp.","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pen/lgs/4514821164.html","adDetails":"Seemed like it could never happen to you, but now you know how humiliating and nerve wracking a DUI arrest is. Your world is turned upside down, what happened is always on your mind. But even if the facts seem solid, an attorney familiar with the DA /Judge on your case can make a BIG difference in if you go to jail, if you keep your license, or how your record reads for the next 10 years. By this letter I offer my service as an attorney who's not only experienced with the Oakland court system but also who knows how to discreetly and efficiently handle a DUI case (we do not include a return address as some prefer to not alert others they have a legal problem). I am a former award-winning asst. DA who, in 25 years of practice, has handled thousands of DUIs. I don't take real criminals (murder, burglary, or even drug cases) as my clients. I don't even take repeat DUI offenders as my clients. Instead I focus on first time DUI cases. Since I concentrate on first time offenses, many Judges see my clients as normal and productive citizens, unlikely to be in trouble again, thus not needing the harsher DUI penalties. Hiring me, as a former DA, assures you I have top legal credentials since applying to be a DA is one of the most competitive law positions. The DA's office has its choice of hundreds, if not thousands, of attorneys, and they pick the \"cream of the crop\". Also, I am not just an ex-DA with general (all types of crimes) criminal experience, I focused on DUIs at the DA's office. I've published/lectured statewide on the same alcohol test device that you took. Hidden about three quarters down your pink 30 day license, the DMV states you have only 10 days to request a hearing or face an automatic suspension (see info sheet enclosed). Only by winning the hearing can your license be returned to you without suspension. YES, these DMV hearings can be won! I have a high winning percentage with hearings, having recently won two in one day. Upon your request I will, at no charge, keep you driving by faxing DMV a hearing request, or you can mail the enclosed card yourself (send it registered mail to keep a record). Many offices will show you a \"name\" attorney and later assign your case to a new lawyer. Since I am the ONLY attorney here, I will handle your case in court. Often I can arrange a reduced charge, no jail, low fine and work related driving (without you in court). Because I handle first time cases without injury, I can keep fees on the low side (under $2000). If you have a case where you hurt someone or have a lengthy record you may want to pay more for the attorney who \"wrote the book\" or is the \"president\" of this or that. However if you line up fees along with experience you'll agree I offer the best value for YOUR case. Bottom line: you surely don't want the cheapest or need the most expensive attorney. Typically I get better results than offices that charge for unnecessary motions that usually fail and serve only to get the Judge and DA annoyed. I also can keep fees low by keeping my expenses down (why pay a receptionist when voice mail will cut my costs). I don't buy a COSTLY Yellow Page ad or send out a glossy booklet. You should know that expenses like these just get passed right along to you as a higher fee!","postDate":"2014-06-10T22:43:29-0700","subCategory":{"category":"legal services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lgs/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.896100","longitude":"-122.111900","info":""}}
