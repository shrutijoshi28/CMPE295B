For Deliveries: I will haul any large purchase you make from Craigslist, Ikea, Costco, Home Depot, Best Buy, Crate-and-Barrel, or other East Bay Area store to your home or other location. Time starts when I show up to meet you at the store. Time ends when we place the item where you want it.

I can also supply a woman's organizing, packing, and cleaning finesse. Total cost (truck + a man's labor + a woman's finesse) = $65 per hour, and $15 for every 15 min interval after that. PAYMENT METHOD: Cash Preferred, although Credit Cards, Bitcoin, Trade, Barter, and Paypal are available upon prior arrangements. Thanks, Aaron PS - If I'm unavailable, I recommend you call one of these other Haulers. Their hauling services are equal to my standards.

Hauling is defined as taking something from one point to another. Moving is defined as changing your residence or office. Dump Runs are when you want some things to disappear from your life. 2. Tips are always welcomed by Craigslist laborers. 3. If you live someplace like the South Bay, don't expect a hauler who works in Oakland to come down and move your couch two miles down the road. It doesn't make economic sense! Please call a hauler in your local area, or expect to pay a lot more to have the work done. 4. If you want your hauler/mover to be insured and licensed, expect to pay more. 5. If you want a flat rate for your job, please be honest with the person you contact. Remember to tell them about the 20 flights of stairs that the item needs to be carried up! 6. All Craigslist laborers prefer cash, and many will not accept anything else. If you want to pay by check or credit card, please tell the person you contact beforehand. 7. There are just as many \"flakes\" who hire Craigslist laborers as there are \"flakes\" who advertise on Craigslist. If you say you'll be somewhere at a certain time, be there!, or call the person and let them know you'll be late. 8. Beware the \"Minimum Time\"! If your hauler is operating on a time payment basis, always ask them what their minimum amount of time is. 9. Buy Locally - Before you buy something on Craigslist, consider the hauling costs! Generally speaking, it doesn't cost much to haul something across town, but the costs rise exponentially as the distance between the pickup and drop-off locations increase. A couch that needs to be hauled 30 miles might cost more to haul than to buy. 10. Don't assume you can ride in the truck! - Most haulers and movers have strict rules against allowing customers to ride in the truck with them (it's a liability issue, and we're a litigious society!). Some haulers will make exceptions. Bottom line - Don't assume! You could be left stranded. 11. When Haulers call themselves \"Green\" (insinuating that others are not) they're misleading you. All haulers are \"Green\"! This is because it costs nothing to recycle what can be recycled. Sometimes, haulers can even get cash for what they recycle. When material must be taken to the dump, it costs money. This is just the economics of the trade. Don't be misled! 12. Have you packed things up well before the mover shows up??? The greatest frustration for any hauler/mover is to show up and have nothing packed or prep'ed beforehand - Everything should be in sealed boxes or bags when the hauler arrives. A poorly pre-packed move is the prime reason why things get broken and go missing. A hauler is only partly responsible for things broken in transit. If you have not taken the time to pack well, don't blame the hauler. \"Banker's Boxes\" are the ideal moving box!!!
