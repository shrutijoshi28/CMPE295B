{"id":"4510999767","adHeader":"Experienced Tutor for Summer!","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4510999767.html","adDetails":"Hello CL, I am a 21 year old male college student looking for any middle school or high school students looking for some additional help this summer, perhaps for summer school help. I have volunteered with the summer school program as a tutor/ teacher's assistant in the past at Iron Horse Middle School. I have been tutoring for about the last year and looking for some summer job opportunities. My rate is $50/hr and definitely willing to work with you for any scheduling needs. I live in San Ramon, and am willing to travel as far as Walnut Creek or Pleasanton. Sessions can take place at your residence or a local library. My normal sessions are an hour but can be as long as three. If you have a child and are interested, please email me. Hope to hear from you soon! Thanks!","postDate":"2014-06-10T20:33:22-0700","subCategory":{"category":"lessons & tutoring","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/lss/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
