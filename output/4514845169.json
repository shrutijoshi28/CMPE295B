If your restraining order is granted, the other person may be ordered to stay away from you, your children, or even have no contact at all, depending on the seriousness of the violence committed. On the other hand, if somebody wrongfully filed a restraining order against you, your rights could be in jeopardy and you could lose custody of your children, pay higher child support, be forced to stay away from another person or places. You must fight the restraining order and you should not do it alone. Having an attorney may substantially increase your odds of winning your case.
