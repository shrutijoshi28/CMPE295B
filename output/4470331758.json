He is conscientious, thorough, and focuses on the the subject matter. He is prompt and does not waste time on chit-chat. -Kyle Smith was excellent in working with my son. My son was in a combo Calculus class and was suppose to take the Calculus AB test but with Kyle's help my son took the Calculus BC.
