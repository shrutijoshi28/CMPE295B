Our Web site is: www.foreverseal.net In essence this company seals granite, stone, tile, grout, etc., inside a building, as well as outside. The Australian Government developed a patented chemical to treat the Sydney Opera house to protect the concrete and marble from wear and fatigue from the salt water elements. We have found that this chemical has great value in protecting granite, tile, stone, concrete and other silica based surfaces. ForeverSeal, LLC, at the request of the chemical developer in Australia, has decided to offer Franchises throughout the United States. In order to facilitate franchising, ForeverSeal requires a nominal investment from an individual or group in the amount of $ 50K to $ 75K. The Prospectus below will detail the plans and how the investor will profit from this funding. 100% of the funding will go to the Franchising opportunity. No money will be applied to commissions, fees, nor salary. After reading the brief prospectus, please feel free to contact the owner of ForeverSeal, Denny Lowe show contact info. A brief look of an exceptional opportunity. . .. . .. . . Forever Seal was formed in early 2010 with money borrowed from friends and relatives. It was started on what could be referred to as a \"shoestring\". It is a company that cleans and permanently seals natural stone, tile, concrete, and grout surfaces, such as counter tops, showers, floors, patios, driveways, and the like. The product we use works by altering the molecular structure of the material, causing it to become permanently repellent. The benefit to the consumer is that it makes it impossible to stain, and very easy to clean. It truly is quite amazing. There was no analysis of the market, no long-term goal-setting, no business plan, and no marketing strategy involved. We were, at the time, just trying to find a way to make a living. . ...and had no expectations or aspirations beyond that. As Forever Seal's founder, I had no prior knowledge of the stone business, or the tile and grout business. . . and was totally unaware that such a thing as sealing such surfaces was required, or for that matter that the process of \"sealing\" even existed. Forever Seal's gross income for the first full month of operation was exactly $500.00, and the first years revenues were only a little over $98,000.00. We slowly built on that meager beginning. As we progressed, we were able to gain insights into exactly who our customers were, and what they wanted,. . . and then crafted a specific system of radio and TV commercials, plus other effective marketing strategies that work in concert with them, that are extremely effective in reaching them, and addressing their concerns. We will do close to $1,000,000.00 this year, the vast majority of which will be generated within a 25 mile radius of our office. Of that amount, close to $100,000.00 will be spent on sealer. For the record, the sealer we use is manufactured by a company called Dry-Treat. They are the recognized leader in the sealing business, and produce unique high-tech, permanent solutions to a number of critical problems that exist within the stone industry, both commercial and residential. Other competing sealers are temporary, and fall short of our sealer in a number of critical areas. As it turns out, essentially all of Dry-treat's other \"users\" are in the business of selling, fabricating, or installing tile and stone surfaces. . ..and are not really in the business of sealing them. In fact, there are very few people anywhere that actually do what we do for a living. We have in fact discovered a hidden \"niche\" business. . ..and have developed a marketing system that allows us to profit from it. Others occasionally do sealing. . .but it isn't the main thrust of their business, and so it gets overlooked or skipped for a variety of reasons. As an example, there are around 25 authorized Dry-Treat applicators in the Puget Sound area, and we presently use more sealer than all of them combined. This has not gone unnoticed by Dry-Treat. They would obviously like to see more companies like ours elsewhere in the country. . ..a lot more. To that end, they are urging us to expand via franchising, or dealerships, or any other way we can. In order to entice us to do so, Dry-Treat has essentially made us an \"offer we can't refuse\". To wit: They will sell us sealer for anyone we put into business, for less than the standard price, and they will drop-ship directly to them from their manufacturing facility in Atlanta. . .meaning that we'll never even touch it. We anticipate being able to sell between 15 and 20 franchises in our first year, and are confident that we'll be able to accelerate the growth of their business pretty much as fast as they can prepare for it. I believe a typical franchise could easily be up to $1,000,000.00 in annual sales by the end of their second year. Accordingly, I estimate that our sales of sealer to franchisees will be close to $400,000.00 in the first year, and should more than double each year thereafter. As such, I expect revenues from the sales of sealer to our franchisees to be over $1,000,000.00 in year two. . .and to at least double every year thereafter. There will also be revenues from the sales of the franchises themselves, (which will average around $25,000.00 each). . ..and there will be revenues from the sale of the chemical supplies we will sell to them, which will including cleaners, etc, which will be \"branded\" under our franchise name. Lastly, there will be the royalties themselves which will be minimal in the beginning, but will gradually increase as the franchisee's businesses mature. First year totals of all these additional revenues should be in the neighborhood of $400,000.00 to $500,000.00, and will approximately double each succeeding year as additional franchisees are added. There's a strong possibility that our first years profits could be in the neighborhood of $1,000,000.00, which we project will start to flow in around 120 days after we start the process of forming our company and preparing the franchise, etc. The steps required in getting set up as a franchiser will include: 1. Formation of a new company, most probably an LLC, that will own the franchise and trademark rights, and that will conduct all sales and related functions and will manage franchisee relations. 2. Preparation of the franchise disclosure Document, including non-disclosure and non-compete agreement, the franchise document itself, including all the necessary disclosures and addendum's. 3. State franchise registration applications, certification page, Seller disclosure forms, cost and source of funds form, consent to service form, corporate acknowledgement and certification. . .and more. 4. A custom Multi-Location franchise website, (including content management system, SEO & analytics), a franchise opportunity video, print & digital marketing templates, online marketing store, print, apparel, and promotional materials, PPC setup and monitoring, press releases, and brand marketing. 5. Securing, furnishing, and equipping a leased facility in an upscale business park that will be used to for franchise sales activities, to conduct franchisee training, to warehouse cleaning supplies and other materials which will be sold to the franchisees, and to headquarter the existing Forever Seal business. (Forever Seal will pay approximately 50% of the monthly rental and utility costs for this facility). Total costs for the foregoing will be between $50,000.00 and $75,000.00, including operating reserves. Investors are invited. The terms of return will be that all of the profits earned by the company over and above operating expenses and set-asides will be paid back to the investors, until they have been fully repaid. . ..after which they will have the option of a permanent share of future revenues, or a generous one-time payment. Paid participation in the day-to-day operation of the company by an investor would be welcomed and encouraged. Franchise sales will be conducted by JD Lowe, and he will also act as CEO, at no cost to the franchising company, until such time that all investors have recouped 100% of their investment.
