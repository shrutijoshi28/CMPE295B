{"id":"4486094464","adHeader":"Pet Owner Looking to Cat/Dog Sit, Walk Dogs","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/pas/4486094464.html","adDetails":"I am a lover of pets, having owned several dogs and many cats since I was a child. I am a small business owner and self-employed contractor looking to pick up additional work taking care of pets. As the owner of my business, I am very responsible and am the primary bill-payer handling the bills, maintaining our townhouse and home office, and I also am the household housekeeper, grocery shopper, laundry-doer, event host, and care-taker to our 2 cats in our household. I love cats and dogs (we have two cats), and I get along great with dogs whether its playing with them or taking them for walks. I also organize households part-time, and all of my clients have pets ranging including cats, dogs, and birds, and I interact with all of my client's pets, not as part of my work, but because I truly love them all and get along with them (and they love playing)! I have a flexible schedule and can start as early as 6 a.m., and work as late as 11 p.m., since the projects for my business clients are flexible, and I sometimes work late at night or on weekends to complete them before deadline. English is my native language, and I am fluent in it (I also majored in English and writing in college at SJSU), and hold a Bachelor's degree. If I sound like someone who can help out your household and care for your pets, please contact me today. I cover the South Bay including San Jose, Santa Clara, Campbell, Los Gatos and Saratoga. My standard rate is $20/hour for one pet, and varies if there are more than one (dog) how many visits, etc. I have a $50 minimum per day. Upon special requests, I will accommodate overnight stays. Rate for overnight service varies depending on the type of pet, amount of hours, and location.","postDate":"2014-06-10T23:23:23-0700","subCategory":{"category":"pet services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/pas/"},"location":{"lattitude":"37.302460","longitude":"-121.933136","info":""}}
