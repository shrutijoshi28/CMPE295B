Tutor forming 2-3 grade summer literacy classes","adLink":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/lss/4485936907.html","adDetails":"I have a literacy class forming for incoming 2nd-3rd graders on Thursdays from 6-7. The Summer class will start the week of June 16 and run for two months with the opportunity to join a class for the Fall if you wish. We will cover informational reading comprehension skills, writing organization and strategies, and summary and non-fiction (report) writing. Classes are $25/student per hour, range in size from 3-5 students, and will meet at my home in Union City. This is the perfect opportunity to improve or review your child's literacy skills during the summer! I have a reading specialist credential, a masters in language and literacy education, and a multiple subject teaching credential. I have taught elementary school for 10 years and have taught privately for 6 years. I have a resume and letters of recommendation and reference available upon request. Please contact me by email if you are interested or have further questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
