Whimsical, beautiful & creepy face art for the San Francisco Bay Area, especially Sonoma, Marin and Napa counties. I use only the finest cosmetic grade face paints and glitter. Please call show contact info or email for a price quote and to reserve your date. Let me know the date and time of your event, and where the event will be held (what town). Also good to know are how many children (or adventurous adults) you expect. Hablo un poco de espa√±ol. Teens and adults love glitter tattoos! Great for pool parties, bar & bat mitzvahs. Gift certificates make fantastic gifts. Discounts available for 501 (c) non-profit organizations. Please see: www.auntiestaceysfacepainting.com for more photos and info. I paint fun!
