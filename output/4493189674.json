Maybe you have been keeping the books on your own and have run into some problems that you need help with or maybe you have worked with bookkeepers in the past who have left your records in disarray. Regardless of how you got to where you are now, the fact is that you need help getting your books in order. That's where I come in. I am a small business accountant with 15 years of experience. I am a Certified Public Bookkeeper and a Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisor. While I do provide ongoing monthly bookkeeping to some of my clients, I specialize in cleaning up messy books. I love digging into accounting records, finding problems and solving them. I am quick and efficient at what I do and you can be confident that when I am finished with your books, they will be in excellent order. I work exclusively with QuickBooks Online and am available to help you transition from your current accounting system to that platform as part of the cleanup process. Please feel free to contact me for more information on how I can help you feel more confident about the financial side of your business. I am happy to offer a free initial consultation and provide references if needed. Yours for Success, Matthew King, CPB www.bookkeepingking.com","postDate":"2014-06-10T19:50:46-0700","subCategory":{"category":"financial services","link":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/fns/"},"location":{"lattitude":null,"longitude":null,"info":""}}
